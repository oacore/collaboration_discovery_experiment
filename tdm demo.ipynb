Introduction\\nIntegrable 1 + 1 dimensional quantum \\ufb01eld theories on a \\ufb01nite space circle were rather\\nintensively studied in the last 20 years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. A great deal of success\\nin the exact treatment of the \\ufb01nite size e\\ufb00ects in various integrable QFT\\u2019s was due to the\\nthermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) approach resulting in a system (in most of the cases\\nin\\ufb01nite) of non-linear integral equations. It was realized that the TBA equations could be\\nrewritten in a functional, Y-system form [2].\\nRecently, a novel, and hopefully quite general approach to this problem was proposed\\nin [11] based on the integrability of the Y-system. The Y-system is known to be a gauge\\ninvariant version of the famous Hirota bilinear equation, often called the T-system, in\\nits discrete form[12]. The underlying discrete Hirota dynamics is integrable and general\\nsolutions with various boundary conditions, appropriate for various problems, from matrix\\nmodels to quantum spin chains and quantum sigma-models, can be found in a determinant\\n(Wronskian) form [13]. For \\ufb01nite rank symmetry groups the matrix of the Wronskian\\ncontains only a \\ufb01nite number of functions of the spectral parameter, drastically simplifying\\nthe problem: the in\\ufb01nite Y-system is reduced to a \\ufb01nite number of non-linear functional\\nequations for these functions. Then the subtlest point comes: We should guess the analytic\\nproperties of these functions w.r.t. the spectral parameter. This is relatively easy to do\\nfor the spin chains where the polynomiality of transfer matrix leads to the \\ufb01nal answer\\nin terms of a set of Bethe ansatz equations. For the QFT\\u2019s at a \\ufb01nite volume L (length\\nof the space circle) the situation is much more complicated and the analyticity properties\\nof the Y-functions are not so obvious. Nevertheless, it often appears to be possible to\\nextract them, partially from physical considerations, partially from certain assumptions of\\nthe absence of unphysical singularities. It helps to transform the Y-system into a system of\\nnon-linear integral equations (NLIE), more tractable, and better suitable for the numerical\\nstudies. The resulting equations can remind the Destri-DeVega NLIE [1] or even coincide\\nwith them for the (rare) models where these DDV equations are known.\\nThis program was performed in [11] for the SU(2)\\xd7SU(2) principal chiral \\ufb01eld (PCF)\\nfor a general quantum state, and the numerical study of the \\ufb01nite size spectrum was\\nsuccessfully done for a variety of interesting states, from the vacuum and mass-gap to quite\\ngeneral states, in the so called U(1) sector or even lying out of it (i.e. having excitations\\nin left and right SU(2) modes).\\nIn this paper, we will construct within these lines the corresponding NLIE\\u2019s for SU(N)\\xd7\\nSU(N) PCF at any N. We use the Wronskian solution of [13] for the underlying Hirota\\nequation in terms of determinants of N \\xd7N matrices and guess the correct analytic form of\\nthe functions entering the Wronskian. For the vacuum state, the asymptotic Bethe ansatz\\n(ABA) based on the scattering theory and, strictly speaking, valid only for su\\ufb03ciently large\\nlength L, teaches us that there are no singularities on the physical strip of the rapidity\\nplane, at least for not too small L\\u2019s.1\\n1The argument can\\u2019t exclude the possibility that at su\\ufb03ciently small size, some extra singularities occur.\\nHowever, our numerics give serious evidence that at least at N = 3 such extra singularities do not appear.\\n\\u2013 2 \\u2013For excited states there are certain poles entering the physical strip, and their qualita-\\ntive structure is guessed from the ABA. The explicit construction is done only for states in\\nthe U(1) sector, but we sketch out the generalization to any state. We show how the exact\\nS-matrix of the model (including the CDD factor) naturally emerges from this approach\\nby simple analyticity assumptions.\\nThe presence of additional singularities on the physical strip related to the bound\\nstates, absent for N = 2, leads in N > 2 case to signi\\ufb01cant modi\\ufb01cations, already in\\nthe expression for the energies of excited states. We \\ufb01nd from our NLIE\\u2019s the \\ufb01nite size\\n(L\\xa8 uscher) corrections which reveal the presence of the so called  -terms. We also test our\\nNLIE\\u2019s analytically, comparing the results with the known analytic data in the ultraviolet\\n(conformal) limit. Finally, we demonstrate the power of our approach by solving the\\nresulting NLIE\\u2019s numerically, for the vacuum energy and the energies of some low lying\\nexcited states as functions of the size mL for N = 3.\\nOne of the principal motivations for our work is the hope to ful\\ufb01ll the same program in\\nthe case of recently constructed AdS/CFT Y-system [14, 15, 16] for the exact spectrum of\\nanomalous dimensions in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The PCF model, having\\nN \\u2212 1 particles (including N \\u2212 2 bound states) in its asymptotic spectrum, bears many\\nsimilarities with the AdS/CFT case where the number of bound states is in\\ufb01nite. The\\ncorresponding Wronskian solutions of AdS/CFT Y-system, or Hirota equation with the so\\ncalled T-hook boundary conditions is already available [17, 18].\\n2. The principal chiral \\ufb01eld model in the large volume\\nIn this section we will give the de\\ufb01nition of the PCF model, remind the reader the scat-\\ntering theory for the physical particles and the ABA equations, and describe the \\ufb01nite size\\nequations in terms of the Y-system.\\n2.1 The PCF model, its S-matrix and the large L ABA\\nThe SU(N) \\xd7 SU(N) PCF model has the classical action\\nSPCF = \\u2212\\n1\\n2e2\\n0\\n \\ndt\\n  L\\n0\\ndx tr(h\\u22121\\u2202\\u03b1h)2 , h \\u2208 SU(N).

Then, using the relativistic invariance, we exchange the\\nroles of time and space and rather solve the problem for the same system but with in\\ufb01nite\\nspace extent R placed into a periodic time L interpreted as the inverse temperature [24].\\nThe full energy spectrum of such an in\\ufb01nite system can be found from the nested BAE\\n(2.6) and from (2.7) by means of the so called string hypothesis. The resulting equations\\nfor the densities of bound states are presented in [25], following the direct solution of the\\nPCF given in [26] (see also [27]). The free energy calculation at a \\ufb01nite temperature for\\nsuch an in\\ufb01nite volume system can be done thermodynamically, using the saddle point\\napproximation due to [28]. Then the resulting integral TBA equations can be rearranged\\ninto the Y-system4\\nY +\\na,s Y \\u2212\\na,s =\\n1 + Ya,s+1\\n1 + (Ya+1,s)\\u22121\\n1 + Ya,s\\u22121\\n1 + (Ya\\u22121,s)\\u22121 (2.8)\\na = 1,2,...,N \\u2212 1; \\u2212\\u221e < s < \\u221e\\nwhere, by de\\ufb01nition, Y0,s = YN,s = \\u221e and we have the following boundary conditions at\\n\\u03b8 \\u2192 \\xb1\\u221e:\\nYa,s \\u223c e\\u2212Lpa(\\u03b8)\\u03b4s,0 \\xd7 consta,s , pa = cosh(\\n2\\u03b8\\u03c0\\nN\\n)\\nsin(a\\u03c0\\nN )\\nsin( \\u03c0\\nN)\\n(2.9)\\nThis Y-system describing PCF is an in\\ufb01nite set of functional equations (2.8) with the\\nfunctions Ya,s(\\u03b8) of the spectral parameter \\u03b8 de\\ufb01ned in the nodes marked by black and\\nwhite bullets in the interior of the in\\ufb01nite strip in a,s lattice represented in \\ufb01g. 2.1.\\nA direct but rather tedious derivation of this Y-system was performed in the Appendix\\nA of [11] for N = 2. The generalization of this calculation to N > 2 is rather straightfor-\\nward, but the Y-system (2.8) is known from other considerations [29] and is a very universal\\nsystem of equations describing the integrable Hirota dynamics.\\n4To make many formulas less bulky, the shifts of the spectral parameter will be often denoted as follows\\nf\\n\\xb1 = f(\\u03b8 \\xb1\\ni\\n2) , f\\n\\xb1\\xb1 = f(\\u03b8 \\xb1 i), and in general f\\n[\\xb1k] = f(\\u03b8 \\xb1\\ni\\n2k).\\n\\u2013 5 \\u2013As we will see later, the expression for the momentum pa(\\u03b8) is the only one compatible\\nwith the Y -system and relativistic invariance, up to a normalization that can be absorbed\\ninto the de\\ufb01nition of the size L of the spin chain5. As a result of (2.9) we see that the\\nmiddle node Y-functions, Ya,0, a = 1,2,    ,N \\u22121, are exponentially suppressed at large\\nL or at large |\\u03b8|.\\nObviously, the Y-system (2.8) has many solutions and to specify a solution we have\\nto describe its analytic properties. To have a qualitative idea of the analyticity we have\\nto consider a certain limit for the solution where we know the corresponding Y-functions\\nentirely as analytic functions of the spectral parameter \\u03b8. The most convenient limit is\\nL \\u2192 \\u221e where we can solve the Y-system directly, with the appropriate physically natural\\nanalyticity assumptions, to obtain explicitly all Y-functions and make a link with the exact\\nscattering matrix and the resulting ABA equations, as it was done for the N = 2 case in\\n[11]. We will give this asymptotic solution in the next section. Then the Y-system, in the\\nform of TBA equations, can be in principle solved numerically by iterations, starting at\\nlarge L and then adiabatically approaching \\ufb01nite, and even very small L\\u2019s corresponding\\nto the ultraviolet CFT behavior. The method was successfully used for various integrable\\nsigma models, including the SU(2) PCF [11, 30, 31, 7]. It will be also the main method of\\nthis paper devoted to the SU(N) PCF for N > 2. For the vacuum state, the information\\nfrom ABA is trivial: it suggests that we don\\u2019t have any singularities in the physical strip\\n\\u2212iN/4 < Im(\\u03b8) < iN/4, at least for not too small L\\u2019s, since there are no Bethe roots.6\\nThe TBA procedure described above leads to the following expression for the vacuum\\nenergy\\nEvacuum(L) = \\u2212\\nm\\nN\\nN\\u22121  \\na=1\\nsin(a\\u03c0\\nN )\\nsin( \\u03c0\\nN)\\n  \\u221e\\n\\u2212\\u221e\\nd\\u03b8cosh\\n \\n2\\u03c0\\nN\\n\\u03b8\\n \\nlog(1 + Ya,0(\\u03b8)) (2.10)\\nWith certain modi\\ufb01cations in the analytic properties of Y-functions, described in the\\nnext section, the equations (2.8-2.10) appear to be appropriate not only for the vacuum\\nstate, as it was originally derived from the string hypothesis, but also for the excited states\\n[3, 4]. Y -functions for various excited states di\\ufb00er by their analytic properties which can\\nbe qualitatively inferred, as it was mentioned above, from the same states in the ABA.\\nA naive heuristic proposal which worked well for N = 2 case is that the excited states\\ncorrespond to the appearance of logarithmic poles in the integrand of (2.10) at the points\\n\\u03b8j where\\nY1,0(\\u03b8j + iN/4) + 1 = 0 (2.11)\\nIf the contour is deformed so that it encircles these singularities, the pole calculation will\\ngive a contribution\\n N\\nj=1 mcosh\\n2\\u03c0\\u03b8j\\nN which \\ufb01ts well the prediction of the ABA formula\\n(2.7). However, the situation appears to be more complicated at N \\u2265 3, already because\\nof the fact that unlike the N = 2 case of [11], the solutions \\u03b8j of (2.11) are not necessarily\\nreal and this naive prescription should be slightly modi\\ufb01ed in order to get a real energy.\\n5So that the length L is actually measured in units of mass.\\n6It does not guarantee that we will not have some singularities entering the physical strip when L\\nbecomes small enough. But our numerical result don\\u2019t suggest such a strange behavior.\\n\\u2013 6 \\u2013This will be explained in detail in the section 5. One should admit that the right formulas\\nfor energies of excited states in the integrable sigma-models are still rather a matter of a\\nnatural guess then of a reliable derivation.

In what follows, we shall distinguish even and odd N\\u2019s.\\n5.1 Energy of state in the U(1) sector at odd N\\u2019s\\nIt is believed that the energy of an excited state can be obtained from (2.10) by an analytic\\ncontinuation in the parameter L. This continuation has the e\\ufb00ect of appearance of new\\nsingularities of the integrand in the physical strip in (2.10) and a certain choice of the\\nintegration contour, enclosing some singularities of the integrand [3, 4]. How it happens\\n\\u2013 12 \\u2013in each particular model or state is usually a rather complicated question. It implies the\\nanalysis of positions of these singularities at a \\ufb01nite L but the large L asymptotics often\\nserves as an important guiding principle.\\nHere we propose a formula for the energies of excited states in the U(1) sector which\\nseems to work well for any odd N. It is based on our numerical and analytic observations,\\nin particular for the N = 3 case. It reads as follows\\nE(L) = \\u2212\\nm\\nN\\nN\\u22121  \\na=1\\nsin(a\\u03c0\\nN )\\nsin( \\u03c0\\nN)\\n  \\u221e\\u2212N i\\n4+a i\\n2\\n\\u2212\\u221e\\u2212N i\\n4+a i\\n2\\nd\\u03b8 cosh\\n \\n2\\u03c0\\nN\\n\\u03b8\\n \\nlog(1 + Ya,0(\\u03b8)) (5.1)\\nso that we have the straight integration contours parallel to the real axis and shifted by\\n\\u2212N i\\n4 + a i\\n2.12\\nLet us explain the reason for such a choice of contours. First, let us note that in order\\nto have a real energy from (5.1) we should impose the following property of Y-functions\\nunder complex-conjugation: Ya,s(\\u03b8) = YN\\u2212a,s(\\xaf \\u03b8). We will restrict ourselves to the gauges\\nwhere this property is a consequence of the relation\\nTa,s(\\u03b8) = TN\\u2212a,s(\\xaf \\u03b8) (5.2)\\nFor \\ufb01nite L, we will focus on the roots \\u03b8j de\\ufb01ned13 by TN\\u22121\\n2 ,0(\\u03b8j + i/4) = 0.\\nDue to the very de\\ufb01nition of 1+Ya,0 =\\nT\\n+\\na,0T\\n\\u2212\\na,0\\nTa+1,0Ta\\u22121,0, each \\u03b8j gives rise to two zeros and\\npoles. In particular, 1 + Y N\\u22121\\n2 ,0(\\u03b8) has a zero and a pole14 at respective positions \\u03b8j \\u2212 i/4\\nand \\u03b8j \\u2212 i/4 because T+\\nN\\u22121\\n2 ,0(\\u03b8j \\u2212 i/4) = 0 and TN\\u22121\\n2 ,0(\\u03b8j \\u2212 i/4) = 0. In the large L limit\\nthese zero and pole almost coincide since \\u03b8j is almost real. By complex conjugation, we\\ncan also say that 1 + Y N+1\\n2 ,0(\\u03b8) has a zero and a pole at respective positions \\u03b8j + i/4 and\\n\\u03b8j + i/4.\\nThis structure is illustrated for N = 3 in \\ufb01gure 2. From the L\\xa8 uscher corrections15, we\\ncan say that the pole occurs below the zero for 1+Y1,0 and vice versa for 1+Y2,0, at least\\nfor roots with even momentum numbers16. This is important to ensure the right answer if\\nwe want the contours to be straight.\\nIn (5.1) we chose the integration contour to pass, for the N\\u22121\\n2 and N+1\\n2 \\u2019th term in the\\nsum, between those zero and pole. Deforming the contour to the real axis and computing\\n12One of the advantages of this straight contour is that it can be easily implemented in numerics. We\\nwill see indeed that the Y functions can be most easily computed on exactly these lines. We will also see\\nthat the statement holds only for roots with even momentum number, but for odd momentum number, the\\n(slightly modi\\ufb01ed) contour stays very close to this straight line.\\n13In this section, we will denote \\u03b8j for \\u03b8\\n( N\\u22121\\n2 )\\nj , because the other types of \\ufb01nite size roots don\\u2019t contribute.\\n14In addition to this zero and pole, 1 + Y N\\u22121\\n2 ,0(\\u03b8) has another zero at \\u03b8j + 3i/4 and a pole at each root\\nof T N\\u22123\\n2 ,0, but this will not have any consequence in the contour argument.\\n15In section 8.1, we detail how this is proved in the asymptotic limit. Our numerics suggests that it is\\nstill true at \\ufb01nite size, and even in the conformal limit.\\n16So that the contour will actually have to be slightly modi\\ufb01ed for roots having odd momentum number.\\nThis will be done in such a manner that (5.3) will stay true.\\n\\u2013 13 \\u2013EN=4 =\\n+\\nR \\u221e\\u2212 \\u0131\\n2\\n\\u2212\\u221e\\u2212 \\u0131\\n2\\n\\u02dc p1 log(1+Y1,0)\\nsin\\u03c0/4\\n+isinh(\\u03c0\\n2\\u03b8j)\\n+\\nR \\u221e\\n\\u2212\\u221e\\n\\u02dc p2 log(1+Y2,0)\\nsin\\u03c0/4\\n\\u2212i\\nsinh(\\n\\u03c0\\n2 (\\u03b8j+ \\u0131\\n2))\\nsin\\u03c0/4\\n+\\nR \\u221e+ \\u0131\\n2\\n\\u2212\\u221e+ \\u0131\\n2\\n\\u02dc p3 log(1+Y3,0)\\nsin\\u03c0/4\\n\\u03b8j +\\n\\u03b8j + i/2\\n\\u03b8j \\u2212 i/2\\n+\\n: Analyticity strip\\n: Pole of 1 + Y2,0\\n: Zero of 1 + Y2,0\\n: Pole of 1 + Y3,0\\n: Zero of 1 + Y3,0\\n: Pole of 1 + Y1,0\\n: Zero of 1 + Y1,0\\nFigure 3: Analyticity of the integrand for the Energy and choice of the contours for N = 4\\nthe contributions of the logarithmic poles enclosed by the contour during that deformation,\\none gets the following formula\\nE(L) = \\u2212\\nm\\nN\\nN\\u22121  \\na=1\\nsin(a\\u03c0\\nN )\\nsin( \\u03c0\\nN)\\n  \\u221e\\n\\u2212\\u221e\\nd\\u03b8 cosh\\n \\n2\\u03c0\\nN\\n\\u03b8\\n \\nlog(1 + Ya,0(\\u03b8)) (5.3)\\n+i\\n \\nj\\nm\\ncos \\u03c0\\n2N\\nsin \\u03c0\\nN\\n \\nsinh\\n \\n2\\u03c0\\nN\\n(\\u03b8j \\u2212 i/4)\\n \\n\\u2212 sinh\\n \\n2\\u03c0\\nN\\n \\xaf \\u03b8j + i/4\\n   \\nIn the thermodynamic limit (L \\u226b 1), the Bethe roots \\u03b8j become real and the second\\nline of (5.3) reduces to the asymptotic result (2.7), whereas the term in the \\ufb01rst line appears\\nto be O(e\\u2212mL).\\n5.2 Energy of state in the U(1) sector at even N\\u2019s\\nWhen N is even, the corresponding contour cannot be chosen as a straight line.

On the other hand, when |Im(\\u03b8)| = N\\n4 , 1 + Ya,0\\n18The way we \\ufb01x this polynomial will be explained in section 7.4, where the \\ufb01nite size Bethe equations\\nare discussed.\\n19up to the precision of our numerical procedure solving these NLIE\\u2019s.\\n\\u2013 16 \\u2013oscillates at Re(\\u03b8) \\u2192 \\u221e, and it diverges when, e.g., |Im(\\u03b8)| \\u2208 [N\\n4 , 3N\\n4 ].

It tells us that in the de\\ufb01nitions (7.5,7.6), the contour\\ncan be shifted up to \\xb1i/2. In other words the functions fj(\\u03b7) are analytic on the strip\\nIm(\\u03b7) < 1/2.\\nIt is noteworthy that even with these contour deformations, the determinant expres-\\nsions (7.1-7.4) describe the function Ta,s(\\u03b8) inside the strip Im(\\u03b8) \\u2208]\\u2212 N\\u22122a\\n4 \\u2212 s\\n2\\u22121,\\u2212N\\u22122a\\n4 +\\ns\\n2 +1[, which is narrower than in equations (7.9,7.11). But we will show that the relatively\\nnarrow strips given by this ansatz are su\\ufb03cient to solve the Y -system and compute the\\nenergies.\\n7.3 Closed system of NLIEs\\nThe gauge freedom under the transformation (6.2,6.3) can be used to impose F1(\\u03b8) =\\nF1(\\u03b8) = 0, which leaves only N \\u22121 independent densities to compute. N \\u22121 equations on\\nthis densities can be obtained by asking that the state is symmetric, i.e. that Ya,\\u2212s = Ya,+s\\nand inserting this requirement into the middle node Y -system equation (3.1)21, in the same\\nmanner as [11].\\n20The analyticity strips for T0,0 and TN,0 can be chosen as half plane thanks to an appropriate gauge.\\n21As a consequence, we are solving the Y -system under the two following constraints : Ya,s \\u223c\\ne\\n\\u2212Lpa(\\u03b8)\\u03b4s,0 \\xd7 consta,s on the one hand, and T\\n(L)\\na,\\u22121 = Ta,1 one the other hand. This second constraint\\nis speci\\ufb01c to symmetric states (which includes the states in the U(1) sector), such that Ya,\\u2212s = Ya,s.\\n\\u2013 17 \\u2013Equation (3.5) is then reduced to:\\nYa,0 = e\\u2212Lpa (Ta,1)2\\nTa\\u22121,0Ta+1,0\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\nT\\n[+N\\u2212a]\\n0,0 T\\n[\\u2212a]\\nN,0\\nT\\n[a\\u2212N]\\n0,0 T\\n[+a]\\nN,0\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\n\\u22c6KN\\n(7.14)\\nOn the other hand, we can write the determinant expression (6.1) for Ta,\\u22121\\n \\n\\u03b8 \\u2212 iN\\u22122a\\n4\\n \\n,\\nand notice that ca,j = qj\\n[+0] while ca+1,j = qj\\n[\\u22120]. After subtracting one column from an-\\nother in the determinant, there is a full column of qj\\n[+0]\\u2212q\\n[\\u22120]\\nj = \\u2212fj which is exponentially\\nsmall and that explains the exponential suppression of Ta,\\u22121.

The simple inversion of the linear system (7.15) brings (7.17)\\ninto the form\\nfj(\\u03b8) = Hj({fk(\\u03b7)}k=2...N\\u22121\\n\\u03b7\\u2208R\\n) (7.18)\\nThis Hj is a contraction mapping in some vicinity of fj = 0 when L is su\\ufb03ciently large since\\nit leads to an exponentially small fj(\\u03b8). This implies that in some vicinity of L = \\u221e, the\\nmapping Hj has a \\ufb01xed point that can be numerically found through repeated iterations\\nof H.\\nThe way we solve Y -system is therefore simply the iteration of (7.18) and a good news\\nis that, at least for N = 3, even at very small L, this procedure seams to converge to a \\ufb01x\\npoint of Hj, giving a complete solution of (7.18) and thus of the Y -system.\\n22The two terms in (7.16) correspond to the fact that before expanding the determinant, we\\u2019ve added\\nand subtracted columns to get one full column of qj\\n[+0] \\u2212 q\\n[\\u22120]\\nj = \\u2212fj and the other one of\\nqj\\n[+0]+q\\n[\\u22120]\\nj\\n2\\n(which corresponds to a principal value in (7.5,7.6)).\\n\\u2013 18 \\u20137.3.1 Numerically workable form for the NLIE\\u2019s\\nOne di\\ufb03culty of this process is that in order to compute the right hand side of (7.17)\\nit is necessary to compute\\n \\nT\\n[+N/2]\\n0,0 T\\n[\\u2212N/2]\\nN,0\\nT\\n[2a\\u22123N/2]\\n0,0 T\\n[\\u2212N/2+2a]\\nN,0\\n \\u22c6KN\\n.

Let us illustrate it for a general U(1) state in the SU(3) case, and also show why\\nthese \\ufb01nite L analogues of Bethe equations are equivalent, at large L, to the ABA Bethe\\nequations on the roots of \\u03d5.\\nFor such a state, the linear system (7.15) can be written as\\n \\nA B\\n\\u2212A \\u2212B\\n  \\nf2\\nf3\\n \\n=\\n \\nT1,\\u22121(\\u03b8 \\u2212 i/4)\\nT2,\\u22121(\\u03b8 + i/4)\\n \\n(7.25)\\n23Actually the right hand side of (7.23) is itself de\\ufb01ned up to a factor of e\\ni 2k\\u03c0\\nN , because any f\\n\\u22c6K = e\\nK\\u2217log f\\nis de\\ufb01ned up to a e\\n2i\\u03c0\\nR\\nK corresponding to the choice of the branch of the log. As a consequence, a more\\nexact statement for (7.24) is Z = e\\ni 2k\\u03c0\\nN . The choice of k is done to reproduce (4.19), where the phase in\\n(2.3) is chosen in such a manner that one particle at rest (\\u03b81 = 0) is a solution of the Bethe equation (4.20).\\nFor states with zero momentum (like the mass gap and the vacuum), this extra phase can also be obtained\\nby requiring a \\u03b8 \\u2192 \\u2212\\u03b8 symmetry, which these states should exhibit.\\n\\u2013 20 \\u2013where A = \\u22121\\n2(q3 + q3) + q\\u2212\\u2212\\n3 and B = 1\\n2(q2 + q2) \\u2212 q\\u2212\\u2212\\n2 .\\nInverting the matrix\\n \\nA B\\n\\u2212A \\u2212B\\n \\n, some singularity could occur at the zeroes of the\\nfunction AB \\u2212 AB, i.e. when the determinant is zero.

The subtlety which arises when N\\nis even, or for the states having, in the asymptotic limit, complex-conjugated complexes\\nof Bethe roots, is that the zeroes of the determinant do not lie on the real axis but ap-\\nproximately on R \\xb1 i/2. The above procedure can in principle be applied anyway, but its\\ninterpretation is less clear because the regularity condition is imposed at the very boundary\\nof the analyticity strip.\\n7.5 Numerical results\\nAs seen in the \\ufb01gure 4, this method allows to compute the energies of U(1) sector excited\\nstates for a wide range of lengths L. We can see that in the IR, L \\u2192 \\u221e limit, the energies\\nof individual states behave mainly according to the number of \\u201cparticles\\u201d forming the state\\n- the number of the Bethe roots \\u03b8j: The vacuum energy tends to 0, while the energies of\\nthe states \\u03b80,\\u03b81 and \\u03b82 tend to 1, and the energy of \\u03b800 tends to 2). In the conformal limit\\nL \\u2192 0 we will see that the behavior is de\\ufb01ned by the \\u201cparticle\\u2019s\\u201d mode numbers: The\\nenergy goes to 2\\u03c0\\nL (\\u2212N2\\u22121\\n12 + n) where n is the total momentum mode number.\\nNumerical restrictions As the length L is decreasing, the algorithm looks worse and\\nworse converging, and the densities become more and more peaked around the endpoints\\nof the distribution. By choosing a small enough interpolation step (the densities fj are\\nnumerically de\\ufb01ned by polynomial interpolation from a \\ufb01nite number of values), it was\\nnevertheless possible to make the algorithm reasonably convergent for the considered states\\nand lengths L, when N = 3. Decreasing further the interpolation step means increasing\\nthe computation time, and the necessary amount of memory, which puts a limit to our\\nprecision and the minimal length24.\\n24We are aware of the fact that our precision for the energy levels is not su\\ufb03ciently good. Our numerical\\nresults are still quite preliminary, we will try to improve them in the nearest future by using a better\\ninterpolation procedure and using more powerful computers. We de\\ufb01nitely believe that our procedure can\\ngive a much better precision than these \\ufb01rst results in the N = 3 case, and we hope also to tackle the N \\u2265 4\\ncase.\\n\\u2013 22 \\u2013L/sin\\n \\u03c0\\n3\\n \\nEvacuum E\\u03b80 E\\u03b81 E\\u03b82 E\\u03b80,0\\n60 \\u2212(7) 10\\u221224 1.00000(0) 1.00(7) 1.28(6) 2.00(3)\\n20 \\u22125.1(6) 10\\u22128 1.00000(0) 1.06(3) 1.23(5) 2.02(6)\\n10 \\u22124.2(0) 10\\u22124 0.99(8) 1.23(3) 1.76(1) 2.08(2)\\n8 \\u22122.80(1) 10\\u22123 0.98(9) 1.3(4) 2.0(6) 2.1(0)\\n4 \\u22120.119(7) 0.87(7) 2.0(2) 3.7(0) 2.1(8)\\n2 \\u22120.782(3) 0.45(2) 3.4(2) 6.8(2) 2.4(3)\\n1 \\u22122.43(2) \\u22120.59(2) 6.2(0) 13.(0) 2.7(7)\\n0.8 \\u22123.29(1) \\u22121.15(7) 7.5(8) 16.(0) 2.9(0)\\n0.4 \\u22127.72(1) \\u22124.21(0) 9.(8) 3.(1) 101 3.2(7)\\n0.2 \\u221216.9(0) \\u221210.9(1) 2.(8) 101 6.(1) 101 3.2(6)\\n0.1 \\u221235.(8) \\u221225.(3) 5.(7) 101 1.(2) 102 2.(0)\\n0.04 \\u221294.(3) \\u221271.(7) 1.(4) 102 3.(0) 102 \\u22125.(4)\\n0.01 \\u22123.9(6) 102 \\u22123.2(2) 102 5.(6) 102 1.(1) 103 \\u22126.(1) 101\\n0.004 \\u22121.0(1) 103 \\u22128.4(7) 102 (1) 103 (3) 103 \\u2212(2) 102\\n0.001 \\u22124.1(6) 103 \\u22123.5(8) 103 (5) 103 (1) 104 \\u2212(1) 103\\nTable 1: Numerical energies for several U(1) sector states at N = 3\\nUnfortunately, at N \\u2265 4 the calculations become heavier and with the size of inter-\\npolation steps we can a\\ufb00ord our algorithm becomes instable already for L of order \\u223c 1\\n(which means we cannot really check the conformal limit for instance).

For instance, it could be that the\\nfunction we iterate over stops to be a contraction mapping but still has a \\ufb01xed point, and\\nmaybe even that by rewriting slightly the functions it could become a contraction again,\\nand extracting its \\ufb01xed point would be possible by iterations.\\n8.

This position can be estimated by computing the densities\\nto the leading order, to deduce the \\ufb01rst correction to T1,0 in order to solve the equation\\nT1,0(\\u03b80 + i/4) = 0.\\nFor the mass gap, this root should be at the origin, up to exponential corrections\\nin L.

Using the asymptotic\\nexpression for fj\\u2019s (which can be extracted by keeping only the leading order in Ta,s and in\\nda,j in the formula (7.17)), one gets \\u03b80 \\u223c\\nie\\u2212\\n\\u221a\\n3L/2\\u0393(\\u2212 1\\n3)\\n2\\n\\u0393(\\n2\\n3)\\n2\\n\\u221a\\n3\\u03c0\\u0393(\\n1\\n3)\\n2 , so that the second term in\\n(5.3), which is sinh\\n 2\\u03c0\\n3 (\\u03b80 \\u2212 i/4)\\n \\n\\u2212sinh\\n 2\\u03c0\\n3\\n \\xaf \\u03b80 + i/4\\n  \\ncan be computed at leading order.\\nThat gives\\nE\\nmassgap\\nL\\u2192\\u221e \\u2243 1 \\u2212\\n \\n32e\\u2212\\n\\u221a\\n3L/2\\u03c03\\n\\u0393\\n 1\\n3\\n 6\\n \\n(8.4)\\nwhich is in very good agreement the numerical results, as can be seen in \\ufb01g. 5\\nMoreover, this expression (8.4) coincides exactly with the so-called  -term [35, 36],\\nwhich is known to dominate the \\ufb01nite-size corrections in the presence of the bound states.\\n8.2 Conformal limit at L \\u2192 0\\nLet us start from the vacuum.

This con\\ufb01rms that these terms where added in a su\\ufb03ciently general manner to\\ndescribe the relevant solutions of the Y -system.\\n9. Discussion\\nWe have presented here, on the example of the SU(N) principal chiral \\ufb01eld model, a\\npotentially powerful and rather general approach to the study of the \\ufb01nite volume spectrum\\nof various integrable 1+1 dimensional sigma-models. The approach continues the ideas of\\n[11] where the method was proposed on the example of the SU(2) PCF, but for N > 2\\nthe method has to be seriously reconsidered due to many new physical features w.r.t. the\\nN = 2 case. In particular, the presence of the bound state particles and the non-reality of\\nthe Bethe roots at \\ufb01nite L show a few qualitatively new features within our approach.\\nFor virtually all integrable sigma models, the TBA-like approach of Al.Zamolodchikov\\ncan be summarized in a very universal system of functional equations, the Y -system. The\\n\\u2013 26 \\u2013Y-system is equivalent to the famous Hirota equation - the Master equation of integrability\\ndescribing in this case the integrable discrete dynamics with respect to a pair of \\u201crepresen-\\ntational\\u201d variables, a,s and the spectral parameter (rapidity) \\u03b8. The boundary conditions\\nfor a,s are de\\ufb01ned by the symmetry algebra of the model, whether as the analytic structure\\nw.r.t. the \\u03b8 variable is in general the most complicated issue, really de\\ufb01ning the dynamics\\nof the model. It is plausible that in fact even the possible analyticity structures are greatly\\nconstrained by Hirota dynamics and by the symmetry algebra. It would be interesting\\nto classify possible types of analyticity stemming from Hirota dynamics and some simple\\nphysical arguments (relativistic invariance, crossing, absence of certain singularities, etc.)\\nrelated to the \\ufb01nite volume sigma models, similarly to the S-matrix bootstrap theory of\\nAl.&A.Zamolodchikov valid only at in\\ufb01nite volume. This could lead to an interesting clas-\\nsi\\ufb01cation of sigma models themselves and eventually to the discovery of new integrable\\nmodels.\\nIn this paper, we managed to transform one such relativistic \\u03c3-model, the SU(N) \\xd7\\nSU(N) principal chiral \\ufb01eld into a \\ufb01nite set of NLIEs, by solving its \\ufb01nite L Y-system\\nin terms of wronskian determinants of a \\ufb01nite number of Q-functions and parameterizing\\nthese Q-functions by N \\u2212 1 densities correcting their large L asymptotics to any \\ufb01nite L.\\nGeneralizes the analytic and numerical results of [11] to N \\u2265 2, and we could numeri-\\ncally check, at least when N = 2,3, that this procedures solves the Y -system, and enables\\nto compute energies for a wide range of lengths L, compatible with the UV conformal\\nlimit and the IR \\ufb01nite size (L\\xa8 uscher) corrections. On the way, we conjectured the natural\\ngeneralization of the energy formula for excited states for the U(1) at \\ufb01nite L, to N \\u2265 2.\\nThis generalization appears to be unexpectedly non-trivial and looks di\\ufb00erent for even and\\nodd N. The question of de\\ufb01nition of the energy formula for excited states deserves a better\\nunderstanding and hopefully the eventual derivation.\\nThe analysis was done for U(1) sector states, and it certainly can and should be\\ngeneralized to any excited state, as was done in [11] for N = 2. To do this, one will\\nhave to understand the asymptotic terms, and the structure of zeroes. In particular some\\nextra zeroes would appear, which might a\\ufb00ect the way the energy is computed by contour\\nmanipulation. Apart from that, the main di\\ufb00erence with U(1) sector would be that for\\nnon-symmetric states (i.e. when Ya,s  = Ya,\\u2212s), it would be necessary to introduce N \\u2212 1\\ndensities for the right wing and N \\u22121 densities for the left wing. One would have to write\\n(3.5) as 2(N \\u22121) di\\ufb00erent equations, by writing the left hand side either as\\nT\\n(R)\\n1,1 T\\n(R)\\n1,\\u22121\\nT\\n(R)\\n2,0 T\\n(R)\\n0,0\\nor as\\nT\\n(L)\\n1,1 T\\n(L)\\n1,\\u22121\\nT\\n(L)\\n2,0 T\\n(L)\\n0,0\\n. But a similar approach based on the wronskian solution of Y-system should a\\npriori still enable us to compute the energies of these states.\\nAn interesting problem which our approach might help to solve is the planar N \\u2192 \\u221e\\nlimit in PCF. This model has a rich history of its comparison to QCD and it might provide\\nan important example of the exactly solvable 2+1 dimensional bosonic string theory, sim-\\nilarly to the matrix quantum mechanical model of the 1+1 dimensional, c = 1 non-critical\\nstring theory proposed and solved in [40]. An exact and explicit solution for it was given\\nin the case of in\\ufb01nite volume L but in the presence of speci\\ufb01c \\u201dmagnetic\\u201d \\ufb01elds [41].\\n\\u2013 27 \\u2013As concerns the numerics, our algorithm converges very well for any length when\\nN \\u2264 3, but for N \\u2265 4 it is very unstable for small enough length L, already at L . 1\\n(which means for instance that we cannot really check the convergence to the conformal\\nUV limit). Hopefully this instability has no direct physical meaning and is just a numerical\\nartifact, due to a poor numeric accuracy, or to a bad choice of the iteration procedure for\\nour NLIEs.\\nWe believe that this method of deriving a \\ufb01nite system of NLIEs for integrable sigma\\nmodels is general and powerful enough to work for much more complicated cases of AdS/CFT\\ncorrespondence, such as the superstring on the AdS5 \\xd7 S5 background dual to N=4 SYM\\ntheory, and the so called ABJM model where the Y -system was already discovered [14, 38,\\n39]. The wronskian quasiclassical character [17] and even the full quantum solution of the\\nHirota dynamics for AdS5/CFT4 [18] are already available. It is left there to understand\\nthe very rich and complicated analyticity structure of Q-functions for short operators to\\ncomplete the derivation of the AdS/CFT NLIE.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe work of VK was partly supported by the ANR grants INT-AdS/CFT (BLAN-06-0124-\\n03) and GranMA (BLAN-08-1-313695) and the grant RFFI 08-02-00287.

More specifically, this paper arises from the experiences of the application of \\nsystemic approaches to workforce re-modelling following the establishment of the \\nnew role of Associate Director Workforce Development (ADWD) (Health and Social \\nCare Integration) for the Shropshire and Staffordshire Workforce Development \\nConfederation. The post was funded by the NHS but the host employer was one of the \\nfour Local Authority Social Services Departments within the boundaries of the \\nShropshire and Staffordshire Strategic Health Authority. The paper sets out \\npractitioner and client notes on the selection and use of systemic methods applied to \\nassist care professionals meet their evolving needs to manage complexity in their \\nworking environment. In this paper the reflections of the commissioning client and \\nthe main consultant/ researcher are included, both in order to provide an accurate \\naccount of the training/ induction process for systems methods, and also as a means to \\nprovide the reader with a sense of the practical issues which arise from such \\nsituations.  \\n \\nThe care workforce is in a climate of continuous change, invoking wide scale \\nrethinking on almost all aspects of its use and development (for a comprehensive \\ndiscussion of key issues see: Davies 2003). The NHS workforce for the Staffordshire \\nand Shropshire area (the focus of this paper) is 35,000 and the social care workforce is \\nestimated to be nearly as great but largely employed outside the Social Services \\nDepartments. Rather, it is supplied by hundreds of different private and charitable \\nbusiness employers (these organisations face their own, related challenges, see: \\nHarris, Cairns et al. 2004). The ADWD post was expected to work at the interface \\nbetween the NHS and the social care sector on workforce development issues. \\n \\nShropshire and Staffordshire Workforce Development Confederation was established \\nin April 2001 to take forward local strategies in support of the national plan for \\nmodernisation of the health and social care workforce. Its formation was part of the \\nNHS restructuring of Regional Authorities which devolved budgets and \\ncommissioning power to these confederations across the country. In 2004 the \\n 3\\nWorkforce Development Confederations in England were integrated into each of the \\n28 Strategic Health Authorities adding another dimension to the latter\\u2019s performance \\nmanagement role which had been constantly expanding since they had been brought \\ninto being in 2002.  \\n \\nIn the Shropshire and Staffordshire area this meant that the Confederation was now to \\nbecome the Workforce Development Directorate (or WDD) of the Shropshire and \\nStaffordshire Strategic Health Authority alongside Directorates for Service \\nImprovement, Health Strategy, and Performance and Finance. The WDD was tasked \\nwith ensuring the local implementation of national policy. Further, and developing \\nfrom this role, there is an expectation that the WDD is also performance managing \\nHuman Resource (HR) improvement aspects of the work of the Health Trusts in line \\nwith Department of Health (DoH) requirements. This is alongside the continuing \\nmulti-million pound commissioning role for university provision of health \\nprofessional programmes and funding of secondment to these.  \\nProblem issues abound for the WDD to manage. Problems of data shortage on vital \\nteams within the NHS are well documented (see, for example: Stubbings and Scott \\n200; Editorial 2004), the development of decentralised teams working at local level \\nseems patchy at best (Deeming 2004), and leadership training and effectiveness \\nremains critical (e.g. see: Hewison and Griffiths 2004; Kristina 2004), yet the goal of \\nflexible workforces, responding to need flexible and autonomous ways remains the \\nphilosophers stone (For a wider discussion on this see: Huselid, Becker et al. 2005) \\n \\nIn the case of Staffordshire and Shropshire, the WDD had a specific need in the \\ndevelopment of capacity in the use of a range of management techniques. The \\nadvertisement for the post of ADWD implies as much:  \\n\\u201cyou will play a key role in modernising service delivery through the effective \\nintegration of social care and health workforce development strategies, initiatives and \\nprocesses. The task is both enormous and multi-faceted. What we\\u2019re working to \\nachieve is not only an understanding of functional processes and the skills \\ndemonstrated by the current workforce to deliver services, but a specification of the \\nskill sets required to deliver evolving, emerging and future service models.\\u201d \\n(Guardian newspaper, June 2001) \\n 4\\nThe need for the application of systemic processes and methods in the further \\ndevelopment of the WDD remit was also clear:  \\n\\u201cIn describing you as the Social Care guru in the WDC, we need to make one point \\nabsolutely clear: this is not the time or place for professional advocacy. The whole \\npoint is to get away from old pitfalls  - demarcation, adversarial budgeting, territorial \\nthinking \\u2013 and build on the essential elements in the make up of multi-skilled teams\\u201d \\nThis systemic quality is further emphasised in following sections, including:  \\n \\n\\u201cTo take forward the integration of modernisation of the Health and Social Care \\nworkforce through the development of integrated workforce planning and \\ndevelopment between the NHS and Social Care; scoping the potential for reducing \\ndemarcation, changing working practices and roles and initiating projects to produce \\nchange; initiating joint reforms in health and social care education and development at \\npre and post qualification levels.\\u201d   \\n(Guardian newspaper, June 2001) \\n \\nFollowing her appointment, the remit for multi-skilled teams initiating projects, \\navoiding old demarcations and adversarial/ territorial thinking was recognised by Ann \\nas demonstrating an implicit need for systemic processes. Such processes impose \\nresponsibilities and rigours on the organisation. As Charlotte Roberts and Jennifer \\nKemeny have argued:  \\n\"You can\\'t redesign your system .. by dividing it into parts; everyone must look at the \\nwhole together. Thus you can\\'t practice systems thinking as an individual - not \\nbecause the discipline itself is difficult, but because good results in a complex system \\ndepend on bringing in as many perspectives as possible. As you put together a team, \\nmake sure all necessary functions are represented, and gain clearance from top \\nmanagement to propose cross-functional solutions, regardless of sensitivities and \\npolitics\" \\n(Senge, Ross et al. 1994 pages 91 - 92)  \\n \\n 5\\n \\nFigure 1. Members of the WDD using Soft Systems Methodology \\n \\nApproaching the Systemic Intervention \\nOn appointment, Ann reflected on the progress being made towards team building \\ngoals. In an early reflective email to a colleague she said:  \\n\\u201cIt is vital to have vision and big picture thinking ability; promoting a whole systems \\napproach while breaking down the steps to change into something manageable and \\nnot too threatening.\\u201d \\n(Private email from ADWD to a colleague in the WDD) \\n \\nIn a separate email Ann developed her thinking as follows: \\n\"I said that I thought my workplan would mean being a programme manager for a \\nrange of projects where I would bring stakeholders together and be a catalyst for them \\nto achieve something that they were wanting to do but didn\\u2019t know how. Two years \\nlater that is exactly what I have been doing.\" \\n(Private email from ADWD to a colleague in the WDD) \\n \\nIn order to provide such a catalyst, Ann approached Simon, to develop a structured, \\nsystemic intervention in the form of training need support and private mentoring. At \\nthis time the needs of the WDD were clearly stated to be focused on six key items in \\nthe terms of engagement: \\n 6\\n1. A series of training events on systemic approaches to project scoping, planning and \\nmanagement.  \\n2. Actual project work to be used as the basis for all training \\n3. A Team based approach to be applied to all training \\n4. The workshop process to be completed 1st October 2003. \\n5. That there be a tailored half day for the Executive team. \\n6. That on-going support via email be provided. \\n \\nThe nature of the approach to be adopted had been agreed to be systemic, \\nparticipatory methods. Ann had gained some first hand experience of systemic/ \\nparticipative approaches at a range of workshops run in London and Rugby and was \\nconvinced that they could meet the needs of Professionals in Staffordshire and \\nShropshire. In her own words:  \\n\"To be able to advise on the scope for integrated workforce planning and development \\nand the methods by which that may be achieved could itself only be achieved through \\nwide consultation with stakeholders. Harvesting these stakeholders\\u2019 ideas whilst \\ngaining an understanding of their opinions, their perspectives and their assumptions \\nwould be an important task en route\". \\n \\nThe main requirement from the WDD was to provide Health and Care Professionals \\nwith transferable skills to aid in the planning, management and development of \\nprojects across the region. It was judged that systemic methods, focused on problem \\nsolving, would be most likely to meet this need. Again, in Ann\\'s words: \\n\"To be able to advise on reforms in working practices and on new roles which may be \\nachievable and provide up to date intelligence on key workforce issues in health and \\nsocial care I would need to create the kind of mini-environments that would enable \\nme to qualitatively research through using \\u201cparticipative inquiry\\u201d and health and care \\npathway and process analysis a shared understanding with those involved across \\ndiffering cultures of the current working practices and roles being applied by the NHS \\nand Social Care organisations\" \\n \\nIt had further been agreed between Ann and Simon that all training involve real \\nprojects in the pipeline. This would help to concentrate participants minds and \\n 7\\nprovide an acid test for the methods - they would need to be seen to be delivering real \\nresults during the learning process.  \\nTeams were engaged in the work. Again this was intended to allow cooperating \\ncolleagues to learn common methods and provide strength in depth to on-going use of \\nthe methods. No one person should be seen as being the team \\'expert\\', all should \\ncontribute and participate. Ann notes on this point: \\n\"The notion of \\u201creleasing\\u201d ideas about the transformations needed and the way to \\nachieve them to bring about the required modernisation from different people in all \\nparts of the affected workforce has been very motivating\". \\n \\nThe original completion date was September 2003. This was subsequently shifted to \\nOctober and then later to early 2004.  \\nThe executive team would also be introduced to the method. This was a crucial plus \\nfor the research as it meant that the WDD would gain understanding of the methods \\nacross the organisational hierarchy. This is rare in the experience of the authors and \\nthe lack of such senior buy-in often means that initiatives lack senior champions later \\nin the process.  \\nFinally, it was agreed that the process would be supported by email and phone support \\nduring the project run-time. This would mean that professionals working on specific, \\ncomplex issues could have access to support in the development of their proposals.  \\n \\nMethodologies applied \\nThe Systems Department at the Open University has been teaching and researching \\nwith systemic approaches for over three decades. Although approaches have changed \\nand developed over time, one main methodology, applied across undergraduate and \\npostgraduate teaching, has been Soft Systems Methodology or SSM. This approach - \\nfirst advocated and subsequently developed by Checkland et al (Checkland 1981; \\nCheckland and Scholes 1990; Checkland 1994; Checkland 2001) has been included in \\nOpen University courses and developed into a distance learning format (Open \\nUniversity 1987; Open University 2000). There has been much discussion about the \\nuse of SSM (Stowell, Holland et al. 1990; Haynes 1995; Jayaratna 1997; Probert \\n1998; Flood 2001; Holwell 2001) and it has been applied in a wide variety of contexts \\n 8\\n- most recently the main author\\'s have turned to the complex field of information \\nsystems (Checkland and Holwell 1998).  \\nSSM has a range of strengths to advocate its use in the development of project \\nplanning and can be seen as an aid to other systemic approaches in encouraging \\nimaginative problem solving (see for example: Brookfield 1991; Issacs 1999; Wenger \\n1999). From the perspective of the present authors these can be listed as: \\n1. a capacity to make use of SSM at a very basic level very quickly - it can be \\nadopted rapidly \\n2. SSM can be applied in such a way as to provide three outcomes essential for a \\nproject: a rich picture of what is, a root definition of what could be and an \\nactivity plan or conceptual model of how to get there.  \\n3. SSM is best used in a participatory manner by mixed teams of stakeholders.  \\n4. SSM is a problem solving approach, it is designed to focus on the kinds of \\nsoft, intangible problems which beset organisations like the UK NHS \\n5. SSM links well as the front end to more formal methods. This allows user \\ngroups to begin their planning with SSM and then move on to more formal \\ntechniques.  \\nAll of these factors keyed in well with the requirements of the WDD as set out in the \\nterms of engagement - most specifically for project scoping and early planning.  \\n \\nIn further developing the project plan, and taking it up to implementation, monitoring \\nand evaluation, the Logical Framework Approach or LFA has been applied in a \\nvariety of contexts (Coleman 1987; Bell 1998; Baccarini 1999; Kumar and Corbridge \\n2002; Biggs and Smith 2003; Crawford 2003; Crawford 2003; Dale 2003) and, as \\nwith SSM, has found its way into Open University Systems teaching (Open \\nUniversity 1997; Open University 2000; Open University 2004). LFA involves the \\ndevelopment of a four by four matrix, containing the main story or the project (the \\nnarrative summary), the main assumptions or risks (a key item - often noted as being \\nabsent or under-represented in project planning (British Computer Society and Royal \\nAcademy of Engineering 2004)) and the means of measuring success in terms of \\nperformance, impact, sustainability and strategy \\u2013 see Table 1. The LFA can provide a \\nsystemic, if highly structured, means to capture the outcomes of SSM.  \\n \\n \\n 9\\nTable 1. The Logical Framework \\nNarrative summary \\ncolumn \\n \\nThe Goal of the \\npurposeful human \\nactivity. Always \\nbeyond the project \\npurpose. \\nAspirational \\nVerifiable \\nindicators \\n \\nThe goal is \\nmeasured by \\nqualitative and \\nquantitative \\nstrategic indicators \\nor ST Is \\nMeans of \\nverification \\n \\nIndicators can be \\nmeasured in by \\ndata or by means of \\nfocus group/ \\nquestionnaire \\nAssumptions or \\nrisks \\n \\nThe risks that \\nwould mean that \\nthe goal was \\nunachievable \\nThe purpose of the \\npurposeful activity: \\nincluding details of \\nbeneficiaries, \\nimplementers, \\ntransformation, \\nassumption, owners \\nand constraints \\nThe purpose is \\nmeasured by \\nqualitative and \\nquantitative \\nsustainability  \\nindicators or SIs \\nIndicators can be \\nmeasured in by \\ndata or by means of \\nfocus group/ \\nquestionnaire \\nThe risks and \\nassumptions that \\nwould render the \\ngoal unrealisable or \\nunachievable even \\nif this purpose was \\nachieved \\nThe outputs of the \\npurposeful activity:  \\nOutput is measured \\n\\u2013 usually \\nquantitatively \\u2013 by \\nimpact indicators - \\nIIs \\nIndicators are \\nusually measured \\nby data or \\nquestionnaire \\nThe risks and \\nassumptions that \\nwould render the \\npurpose \\nunrealisable or \\nunachievable even \\nif these outputs \\nwere achieved \\nThe key activities \\nfor the purposeful \\nactivity \\nActivity is \\nmeasured \\nquantitatively by \\nperformance \\nindicators \\u2013 PIs \\nIndicators are \\nmeasured by data \\nor questionnaire \\nThe risks and \\nassumptions that \\nwould render the \\noutputs \\nunrealisable or \\nunachievable even \\nif these activities  \\nwere successful  \\n \\nIn an earlier paper Bell applied this - specifically as a means to explore the outcomes \\nof SSM analysis (Bell 2000). Although it is not without numerous critics - and it can \\ncertainly be applied in a non-participatory and top-down manner (Gasper 1997; \\nGasper 2000), it remains a commonly used method in many difficult and complex \\ncontexts. Key to the virtues of LFA are: \\n1. It can be applied in context and rapidly \\n2. It lends itself to participatory workshops \\n3. It can be revised readily \\n4. it does not require software or IT solutions. \\n 10\\n5. it links in to other, even more formal project planning methods if necessary.  \\nAgain, these five factors all have resonances with the needs of the Directorate. \\n \\nResearch Question, Workshops outcomes and participant reflections \\nIn May 2003 Ann took a proposal in the form of a discussion paper to the WDD \\nExecutive team meeting. They had already approved an experimental day with some \\nmembers of the team and Simon Bell to explore the possibilities of the methodologies \\nhe could introduce. A key question was, could systemic tools and techniques \\neffectively develop the various work streams of the WDD? \\n  \\nA recently completed review of the Confederation\\u2019s Organisational Structure and \\nProcesses had recommended that it needed to build up its project management \\napproach. Ann\\'s paper proposed adopting the use of the Logical Framework model for \\nproject planning and agreeing other suitable systems for scoping, monitoring, \\nreviewing and reporting on all of the project based work being undertaken.  \\nOn Ann\\'s agenda was the plan to help facilitate these developments for the work \\nwhich other members of the Confederation team were responsible for while at the \\nsame time helping to ensure that social care and health interface issues were \\nprioritised for urgent development using these methods.  \\nSo, at the instigation of the WDD, a training package for project planning and \\ndevelopment was put together which was based upon user-focused variations of SSM \\nand LFA. Over a period of eleven months - from April 2003 - May 2004 more than a \\ndozen training events took place.  \\nMost of the events were either focused on SSM or LFA or, if time allowed - made use \\nof both. The user need was paramount and if certain teams needed help with scoping \\ntheir specific project, as opposed to planning the detail, then elements of SSM would \\nbe applied. It was also notable that, as time progressed, teams began making use of \\nkey elements of either methodology, out of sequence, if they thought it would be \\nvaluable to them.  \\n  \\nFollowing the workshops a random sample of Participants was asked to comment on \\nthe value of the various aspects applied. Concerning the overall use of SSM: \\n \\n 11\\nWayne Coombe, Head of Human Resources, Staffordshire Social Care and Health \\nmade the following observations:  \\n\"My experience of Logframe/Soft Systems to date has been very positive \\u2026I have \\nfound it a useful (yet ultimately simple) technique for pulling together groups of \\nindividuals from different organisations (or sub sections of the same organisation). I \\nfind that it helps groups who sometimes have significantly contradicting or differing \\nviews to reach a consensus on a way forward, yet without any one group or any \\nindividual dominating and imposing their own objectives and the experience of \\nothers.\" \\n \\n \\nFigure 2. A rich picture of the workforce planning scenario \\n \\nColin Harriden, a Social Care Workforce Planner, speaking about a workshop for \\nRaising the profile of Workforce Planning in Social Care said that systemic methods:  \\n\"Enabled a group of senior HR managers in Social Services to work against their \\nrelative disempowerment and devise a strategy to promote HR and workforce \\nplanning at all levels. The first planned outcome is an event for directorate/CEO level \\nto get workforce planning on the agenda and identify champions.\" \\nWhen Colin was involved in the use of soft systems with another team he observed: \\n 12\\n\"The soft systems model enabled a large and diverse group of managers to collaborate  \\nin developing common themes and purpose.\" \\n \\nColin also made use of Logical Frameworks. He says: \\n\"Log frame created focused energy - identifying key players assumptions and barriers \\nto be addressed. Statement seemed broad but led to specific focus.\" \\n \\nBut when working with another team with LFA he observed the problem of handing \\non previous work to a new group: He noted: \\n\"Learning disability workforce strategy - difficult to use an existing log-frame with a \\nnew group. . participants need to own the development of the purpose and other \\nelements. Side-step to key tasks and barriers helped to re-engage. \\nGenerally - the longer you have the more focus and progress towards achievement.\" \\n \\n \\nFigure 3. Developing a rich picture  \\n \\n 13\\n \\nFigure 4. An early root definition for training strategy \\nPositive comments came from most participants, but critical issues remained. For \\nexample, Fiona Shield, Changing Working Practice Coordinator noted some good \\noutcomes from her work \\n \\n\"I have persevered with the logframe and found it useful. \\n \\u2026. we ended up with 3 versions - 1 per health economy. Although the groups were \\nsmall each logframe had its own \\'flavour\\', which we felt was very important in terms \\nof reflecting local ownership and culture. When I informed the SHA Trust Directors \\nof Modernisation about this work they asked if I could produce one framework for the \\nwhole patch. I did this by informal thematic analysis \\u2026 and kept it to the Purpose and \\nOutputs with indicators (attached).\" \\nHowever, Fiona had some pithy comments about the use of systemic methods - most \\nspecifically Logical Framework in her case:  \\n\"I keep asking the Trust CWP leads if they are happy with the Logframe and can\\'t \\nhonestly say that they really understand or utilise it. BUT I find it a very useful \\nworking tool to refer back to periodically. I think the main problem is that it quickly \\nbecomes out of date in terms of the specific outputs and indicators. I could keep \\n 14\\nupdating it, but then it would lose the ownership of the wider team. However the 1 \\nside of A4 attached is quite an impressive document to cirulate when people ask what \\nI do and what CWP is about!! We also use it within the team of CWP facilitators to \\nhelp check the direction of current work.\" \\nMore recently, Fiona has added that, the outcome she was looking for was for the \\nwork of the role re-designers to become embedded within the work of the Trusts. But \\nhow to evaluate if this has been happening and if so if it was the work of her team that \\nhas made it happen? What she can prove is that she had measures in place as part of \\nthe project plan. The Logframe was the work plan and seemed to provide a very good \\nframework to measure themselves against. Revisiting the Logframe as an evaluation \\nexercise and using it as a review tool has given a recent added value for Fiona and her \\nteam for all the work that went into producing it. They can see where they\\u2019ve come \\nfrom. As she says:  \\n\\u201cWe can step back and say: we had something to do and we got on with it\\u201d. \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 5. Tasks and issues arising from a rich picture exercise \\n \\n 15\\nLynne Lewis, NVQ/Learning Account Manager applied Logical Framework approach \\nto her project: Moving Forward Together For People With Learning Disability \\nLynne comments on the process as follows:  \\n\"I have used the process of Logical Frameworks for a project to assist with the Skills \\nEscalator approach within Learning Disabilities. The process of logical framework \\nhas assisted with a systematic approach to achieving a goal. It breaks down tasks into \\nbite sized processes, with clear progression to the ultimate goal. The difference from \\nmy own personal point of view with this process compared to the average action plan, \\nis the thought process behind the bite sized processes. Thought of what could happen, \\nand what effect this has on the overall process. An ordinary action plan will inform \\nwho does what by when, but does not inform of the contingency plans. My own style \\nof learning was assisted by having the dedicated tutor working through the logical \\nframework step by step, with a dedicated group, for a common goal. I found a \\nprevious session of logical frameworks with a very large group less effective. \\n \\n \\nFigure 6. An activity plan \\n \\n 16\\nJane Rook, (Podiatry Continuous Professional Development), who was lead for the \\nWDD and was project managing the development of an agreed system in Shropshire \\nand Staffordshire for re-registration of Podiatrists with the Health Professional \\nCouncil observed: \\n\"There is something about having the actual flip chart paper to work from and \\n the post it notes that makes the log frame real and living. I have preferred to have \\nthese big and creative bits of paper on the wall to work from and the rich picture to \\nwork from in terms of further working out how to tackle the unsaid issues. \\nWe are almost at the end of the project and the log frame was a timely reminder as we \\nwent along of how to plan to achieve specific targets and to keep me on target. \\nVery encouraging to tick off the boxes as I went along . \\nI did write the document up properly but have used this version only to send out to \\nprove that I do have a project plan to work to. I think it was a definite focus for the \\nsteering group to work to as well They have appreciated that the wider Authority \\nworks to this planning process and felt more corporate as a result. \\nAll in all it was probably a lot easier than some of the project plans based on \\nMicrosoft and Prince systems. Probably appealed to my need for visual clues for my \\nlearning style\" \\nIn private communication Jane has indicated that she would have liked to have used \\nthe methodology with the Steering Group right at the beginning of her planning \\nprocess but even half way through it was worth doing and proved valuable. Two \\nmajor benefits included:  \\n\\u2022 it enabled the mixed range of different kinds of managers with a diverse \\nunderstanding of project management (Prinz, Microsoft etc.) to share one \\napproach and secondly  \\n\\u2022 it enabled really meaningful conversations with all voices being valued as to \\nwhat the project was about and whether or not everyone shared the same \\nvision. . \\n \\n 17\\n \\nFigure 7. A Logical Framework under development \\n \\nAnn, as commissioning officer for the workshops observed:  \\n\"The dimension that has emerged as so powerful for me in this research is the quality \\nof the learning that has been going on in the workshops as groups of colleagues \\ndiscussed the elements of their project in order to agree the plan.\"  \\n \\nAuthor Reflections and Conclusions  \\nAs already stated, the authors are not making definitive claims for the WDD \\nexperience but, recalling our initial research question: \"could systemic tools and \\ntechniques effectively develop the various work streams of the WDD?\", from the \\ncomments of participants, and the experiences of the authors some modest claims, \\nseeking further testing, can be suggested: \\n1. The use of systemic and participatory techniques was greeted by most of those \\non the workshops as a relief and a change from their previous experiences of \\nsuch events.  \\n 18\\n2. SSM provided teams with the basis to think widely and divergently about their \\nwork context and gave them the \\'slack\\' to think differently \\n3. Most of those involved in teams which they worked with regularly, found the \\nexperience helpful to the deeper understanding of the tasks which they had \\nbeen allocated. \\n4. Those who worked in unfamiliar teams found the brainstorming and sharing \\ninvolved helpful in their wider understanding of the work of the SSWDD \\n5. LFA was seen as being a readily applicable tool for project planning.  \\n \\nIf these are the positive reflections, some more negative outcomes were: \\n1. Small teams seemed to get more from the process than large \\n2. The work of one team was not readily understandable or usable to another \\n3. The sustainability of the process is a key point. Without renewal and \\ncontinued investment in support - some of the good outcomes of the process \\ncould dilute over time.  \\n \\nIn summary, it appears to the authors that some important foundations have been built \\nfor essential collaboration to deliver workforce solutions to the challenging task of \\ntrying to achieve integrated services in the Staffordshire and Shropshire areas. Most \\ncritically, an awareness of the importance of a methodical approach to planning major \\nnew initiatives has been raised. \\n \\n 19\\n \\nReferences \\nBaccarini, D.

More specifically, this paper arises from the experiences of the application of \\nsystemic approaches to workforce re-modelling following the establishment of the \\nnew role of Associate Director Workforce Development (ADWD) (Health and Social \\nCare Integration) for the Shropshire and Staffordshire Workforce Development \\nConfederation. The post was funded by the NHS but the host employer was one of the \\nfour Local Authority Social Services Departments within the boundaries of the \\nShropshire and Staffordshire Strategic Health Authority. The paper sets out \\npractitioner and client notes on the selection and use of systemic methods applied to \\nassist care professionals meet their evolving needs to manage complexity in their \\nworking environment. In this paper the reflections of the commissioning client and \\nthe main consultant/ researcher are included, both in order to provide an accurate \\naccount of the training/ induction process for systems methods, and also as a means to \\nprovide the reader with a sense of the practical issues which arise from such \\nsituations.  \\n \\nThe care workforce is in a climate of continuous change, invoking wide scale \\nrethinking on almost all aspects of its use and development (for a comprehensive \\ndiscussion of key issues see: Davies 2003). The NHS workforce for the Staffordshire \\nand Shropshire area (the focus of this paper) is 35,000 and the social care workforce is \\nestimated to be nearly as great but largely employed outside the Social Services \\nDepartments. Rather, it is supplied by hundreds of different private and charitable \\nbusiness employers (these organisations face their own, related challenges, see: \\nHarris, Cairns et al. 2004). The ADWD post was expected to work at the interface \\nbetween the NHS and the social care sector on workforce development issues. \\n \\nShropshire and Staffordshire Workforce Development Confederation was established \\nin April 2001 to take forward local strategies in support of the national plan for \\nmodernisation of the health and social care workforce. Its formation was part of the \\nNHS restructuring of Regional Authorities which devolved budgets and \\ncommissioning power to these confederations across the country. In 2004 the \\n 3\\nWorkforce Development Confederations in England were integrated into each of the \\n28 Strategic Health Authorities adding another dimension to the latter\\u2019s performance \\nmanagement role which had been constantly expanding since they had been brought \\ninto being in 2002.  \\n \\nIn the Shropshire and Staffordshire area this meant that the Confederation was now to \\nbecome the Workforce Development Directorate (or WDD) of the Shropshire and \\nStaffordshire Strategic Health Authority alongside Directorates for Service \\nImprovement, Health Strategy, and Performance and Finance. The WDD was tasked \\nwith ensuring the local implementation of national policy. Further, and developing \\nfrom this role, there is an expectation that the WDD is also performance managing \\nHuman Resource (HR) improvement aspects of the work of the Health Trusts in line \\nwith Department of Health (DoH) requirements. This is alongside the continuing \\nmulti-million pound commissioning role for university provision of health \\nprofessional programmes and funding of secondment to these.  \\nProblem issues abound for the WDD to manage. Problems of data shortage on vital \\nteams within the NHS are well documented (see, for example: Stubbings and Scott \\n200; Editorial 2004), the development of decentralised teams working at local level \\nseems patchy at best (Deeming 2004), and leadership training and effectiveness \\nremains critical (e.g. see: Hewison and Griffiths 2004; Kristina 2004), yet the goal of \\nflexible workforces, responding to need flexible and autonomous ways remains the \\nphilosophers stone (For a wider discussion on this see: Huselid, Becker et al. 2005) \\n \\nIn the case of Staffordshire and Shropshire, the WDD had a specific need in the \\ndevelopment of capacity in the use of a range of management techniques. The \\nadvertisement for the post of ADWD implies as much:  \\n\\u201cyou will play a key role in modernising service delivery through the effective \\nintegration of social care and health workforce development strategies, initiatives and \\nprocesses. The task is both enormous and multi-faceted. What we\\u2019re working to \\nachieve is not only an understanding of functional processes and the skills \\ndemonstrated by the current workforce to deliver services, but a specification of the \\nskill sets required to deliver evolving, emerging and future service models.\\u201d \\n(Guardian newspaper, June 2001) \\n 4\\nThe need for the application of systemic processes and methods in the further \\ndevelopment of the WDD remit was also clear:  \\n\\u201cIn describing you as the Social Care guru in the WDC, we need to make one point \\nabsolutely clear: this is not the time or place for professional advocacy. The whole \\npoint is to get away from old pitfalls  - demarcation, adversarial budgeting, territorial \\nthinking \\u2013 and build on the essential elements in the make up of multi-skilled teams\\u201d \\nThis systemic quality is further emphasised in following sections, including:  \\n \\n\\u201cTo take forward the integration of modernisation of the Health and Social Care \\nworkforce through the development of integrated workforce planning and \\ndevelopment between the NHS and Social Care; scoping the potential for reducing \\ndemarcation, changing working practices and roles and initiating projects to produce \\nchange; initiating joint reforms in health and social care education and development at \\npre and post qualification levels.\\u201d   \\n(Guardian newspaper, June 2001) \\n \\nFollowing her appointment, the remit for multi-skilled teams initiating projects, \\navoiding old demarcations and adversarial/ territorial thinking was recognised by Ann \\nas demonstrating an implicit need for systemic processes. Such processes impose \\nresponsibilities and rigours on the organisation. As Charlotte Roberts and Jennifer \\nKemeny have argued:  \\n\"You can\\'t redesign your system .. by dividing it into parts; everyone must look at the \\nwhole together. Thus you can\\'t practice systems thinking as an individual - not \\nbecause the discipline itself is difficult, but because good results in a complex system \\ndepend on bringing in as many perspectives as possible. As you put together a team, \\nmake sure all necessary functions are represented, and gain clearance from top \\nmanagement to propose cross-functional solutions, regardless of sensitivities and \\npolitics\" \\n(Senge, Ross et al. 1994 pages 91 - 92)  \\n \\n 5\\n \\nFigure 1. Members of the WDD using Soft Systems Methodology \\n \\nApproaching the Systemic Intervention \\nOn appointment, Ann reflected on the progress being made towards team building \\ngoals. In an early reflective email to a colleague she said:  \\n\\u201cIt is vital to have vision and big picture thinking ability; promoting a whole systems \\napproach while breaking down the steps to change into something manageable and \\nnot too threatening.\\u201d \\n(Private email from ADWD to a colleague in the WDD) \\n \\nIn a separate email Ann developed her thinking as follows: \\n\"I said that I thought my workplan would mean being a programme manager for a \\nrange of projects where I would bring stakeholders together and be a catalyst for them \\nto achieve something that they were wanting to do but didn\\u2019t know how. Two years \\nlater that is exactly what I have been doing.\" \\n(Private email from ADWD to a colleague in the WDD) \\n \\nIn order to provide such a catalyst, Ann approached Simon, to develop a structured, \\nsystemic intervention in the form of training need support and private mentoring. At \\nthis time the needs of the WDD were clearly stated to be focused on six key items in \\nthe terms of engagement: \\n 6\\n1. A series of training events on systemic approaches to project scoping, planning and \\nmanagement.  \\n2. Actual project work to be used as the basis for all training \\n3. A Team based approach to be applied to all training \\n4. The workshop process to be completed 1st October 2003. \\n5. That there be a tailored half day for the Executive team. \\n6. That on-going support via email be provided. \\n \\nThe nature of the approach to be adopted had been agreed to be systemic, \\nparticipatory methods. Ann had gained some first hand experience of systemic/ \\nparticipative approaches at a range of workshops run in London and Rugby and was \\nconvinced that they could meet the needs of Professionals in Staffordshire and \\nShropshire. In her own words:  \\n\"To be able to advise on the scope for integrated workforce planning and development \\nand the methods by which that may be achieved could itself only be achieved through \\nwide consultation with stakeholders. Harvesting these stakeholders\\u2019 ideas whilst \\ngaining an understanding of their opinions, their perspectives and their assumptions \\nwould be an important task en route\". \\n \\nThe main requirement from the WDD was to provide Health and Care Professionals \\nwith transferable skills to aid in the planning, management and development of \\nprojects across the region. It was judged that systemic methods, focused on problem \\nsolving, would be most likely to meet this need. Again, in Ann\\'s words: \\n\"To be able to advise on reforms in working practices and on new roles which may be \\nachievable and provide up to date intelligence on key workforce issues in health and \\nsocial care I would need to create the kind of mini-environments that would enable \\nme to qualitatively research through using \\u201cparticipative inquiry\\u201d and health and care \\npathway and process analysis a shared understanding with those involved across \\ndiffering cultures of the current working practices and roles being applied by the NHS \\nand Social Care organisations\" \\n \\nIt had further been agreed between Ann and Simon that all training involve real \\nprojects in the pipeline. This would help to concentrate participants minds and \\n 7\\nprovide an acid test for the methods - they would need to be seen to be delivering real \\nresults during the learning process.  \\nTeams were engaged in the work. Again this was intended to allow cooperating \\ncolleagues to learn common methods and provide strength in depth to on-going use of \\nthe methods. No one person should be seen as being the team \\'expert\\', all should \\ncontribute and participate. Ann notes on this point: \\n\"The notion of \\u201creleasing\\u201d ideas about the transformations needed and the way to \\nachieve them to bring about the required modernisation from different people in all \\nparts of the affected workforce has been very motivating\". \\n \\nThe original completion date was September 2003. This was subsequently shifted to \\nOctober and then later to early 2004.  \\nThe executive team would also be introduced to the method. This was a crucial plus \\nfor the research as it meant that the WDD would gain understanding of the methods \\nacross the organisational hierarchy. This is rare in the experience of the authors and \\nthe lack of such senior buy-in often means that initiatives lack senior champions later \\nin the process.  \\nFinally, it was agreed that the process would be supported by email and phone support \\nduring the project run-time. This would mean that professionals working on specific, \\ncomplex issues could have access to support in the development of their proposals.  \\n \\nMethodologies applied \\nThe Systems Department at the Open University has been teaching and researching \\nwith systemic approaches for over three decades. Although approaches have changed \\nand developed over time, one main methodology, applied across undergraduate and \\npostgraduate teaching, has been Soft Systems Methodology or SSM. This approach - \\nfirst advocated and subsequently developed by Checkland et al (Checkland 1981; \\nCheckland and Scholes 1990; Checkland 1994; Checkland 2001) has been included in \\nOpen University courses and developed into a distance learning format (Open \\nUniversity 1987; Open University 2000). There has been much discussion about the \\nuse of SSM (Stowell, Holland et al. 1990; Haynes 1995; Jayaratna 1997; Probert \\n1998; Flood 2001; Holwell 2001) and it has been applied in a wide variety of contexts \\n 8\\n- most recently the main author\\'s have turned to the complex field of information \\nsystems (Checkland and Holwell 1998).  \\nSSM has a range of strengths to advocate its use in the development of project \\nplanning and can be seen as an aid to other systemic approaches in encouraging \\nimaginative problem solving (see for example: Brookfield 1991; Issacs 1999; Wenger \\n1999). From the perspective of the present authors these can be listed as: \\n1. a capacity to make use of SSM at a very basic level very quickly - it can be \\nadopted rapidly \\n2. SSM can be applied in such a way as to provide three outcomes essential for a \\nproject: a rich picture of what is, a root definition of what could be and an \\nactivity plan or conceptual model of how to get there.  \\n3. SSM is best used in a participatory manner by mixed teams of stakeholders.  \\n4. SSM is a problem solving approach, it is designed to focus on the kinds of \\nsoft, intangible problems which beset organisations like the UK NHS \\n5. SSM links well as the front end to more formal methods. This allows user \\ngroups to begin their planning with SSM and then move on to more formal \\ntechniques.  \\nAll of these factors keyed in well with the requirements of the WDD as set out in the \\nterms of engagement - most specifically for project scoping and early planning.  \\n \\nIn further developing the project plan, and taking it up to implementation, monitoring \\nand evaluation, the Logical Framework Approach or LFA has been applied in a \\nvariety of contexts (Coleman 1987; Bell 1998; Baccarini 1999; Kumar and Corbridge \\n2002; Biggs and Smith 2003; Crawford 2003; Crawford 2003; Dale 2003) and, as \\nwith SSM, has found its way into Open University Systems teaching (Open \\nUniversity 1997; Open University 2000; Open University 2004). LFA involves the \\ndevelopment of a four by four matrix, containing the main story or the project (the \\nnarrative summary), the main assumptions or risks (a key item - often noted as being \\nabsent or under-represented in project planning (British Computer Society and Royal \\nAcademy of Engineering 2004)) and the means of measuring success in terms of \\nperformance, impact, sustainability and strategy \\u2013 see Table 1. The LFA can provide a \\nsystemic, if highly structured, means to capture the outcomes of SSM.  \\n \\n \\n 9\\nTable 1.

Although it is not without numerous critics - and it can \\ncertainly be applied in a non-participatory and top-down manner (Gasper 1997; \\nGasper 2000), it remains a commonly used method in many difficult and complex \\ncontexts. Key to the virtues of LFA are: \\n1. It can be applied in context and rapidly \\n2. It lends itself to participatory workshops \\n3. It can be revised readily \\n4. it does not require software or IT solutions. \\n 10\\n5. it links in to other, even more formal project planning methods if necessary.  \\nAgain, these five factors all have resonances with the needs of the Directorate. \\n \\nResearch Question, Workshops outcomes and participant reflections \\nIn May 2003 Ann took a proposal in the form of a discussion paper to the WDD \\nExecutive team meeting. They had already approved an experimental day with some \\nmembers of the team and Simon Bell to explore the possibilities of the methodologies \\nhe could introduce. A key question was, could systemic tools and techniques \\neffectively develop the various work streams of the WDD? \\n  \\nA recently completed review of the Confederation\\u2019s Organisational Structure and \\nProcesses had recommended that it needed to build up its project management \\napproach. Ann\\'s paper proposed adopting the use of the Logical Framework model for \\nproject planning and agreeing other suitable systems for scoping, monitoring, \\nreviewing and reporting on all of the project based work being undertaken.  \\nOn Ann\\'s agenda was the plan to help facilitate these developments for the work \\nwhich other members of the Confederation team were responsible for while at the \\nsame time helping to ensure that social care and health interface issues were \\nprioritised for urgent development using these methods.  \\nSo, at the instigation of the WDD, a training package for project planning and \\ndevelopment was put together which was based upon user-focused variations of SSM \\nand LFA. Over a period of eleven months - from April 2003 - May 2004 more than a \\ndozen training events took place.  \\nMost of the events were either focused on SSM or LFA or, if time allowed - made use \\nof both. The user need was paramount and if certain teams needed help with scoping \\ntheir specific project, as opposed to planning the detail, then elements of SSM would \\nbe applied. It was also notable that, as time progressed, teams began making use of \\nkey elements of either methodology, out of sequence, if they thought it would be \\nvaluable to them.  \\n  \\nFollowing the workshops a random sample of Participants was asked to comment on \\nthe value of the various aspects applied. Concerning the overall use of SSM: \\n \\n 11\\nWayne Coombe, Head of Human Resources, Staffordshire Social Care and Health \\nmade the following observations:  \\n\"My experience of Logframe/Soft Systems to date has been very positive \\u2026I have \\nfound it a useful (yet ultimately simple) technique for pulling together groups of \\nindividuals from different organisations (or sub sections of the same organisation). I \\nfind that it helps groups who sometimes have significantly contradicting or differing \\nviews to reach a consensus on a way forward, yet without any one group or any \\nindividual dominating and imposing their own objectives and the experience of \\nothers.\" \\n \\n \\nFigure 2. A rich picture of the workforce planning scenario \\n \\nColin Harriden, a Social Care Workforce Planner, speaking about a workshop for \\nRaising the profile of Workforce Planning in Social Care said that systemic methods:  \\n\"Enabled a group of senior HR managers in Social Services to work against their \\nrelative disempowerment and devise a strategy to promote HR and workforce \\nplanning at all levels. The first planned outcome is an event for directorate/CEO level \\nto get workforce planning on the agenda and identify champions.\" \\nWhen Colin was involved in the use of soft systems with another team he observed: \\n 12\\n\"The soft systems model enabled a large and diverse group of managers to collaborate  \\nin developing common themes and purpose.\" \\n \\nColin also made use of Logical Frameworks. He says: \\n\"Log frame created focused energy - identifying key players assumptions and barriers \\nto be addressed. Statement seemed broad but led to specific focus.\" \\n \\nBut when working with another team with LFA he observed the problem of handing \\non previous work to a new group: He noted: \\n\"Learning disability workforce strategy - difficult to use an existing log-frame with a \\nnew group. . participants need to own the development of the purpose and other \\nelements. Side-step to key tasks and barriers helped to re-engage. \\nGenerally - the longer you have the more focus and progress towards achievement.\" \\n \\n \\nFigure 3. Developing a rich picture  \\n \\n 13\\n \\nFigure 4. An early root definition for training strategy \\nPositive comments came from most participants, but critical issues remained. For \\nexample, Fiona Shield, Changing Working Practice Coordinator noted some good \\noutcomes from her work \\n \\n\"I have persevered with the logframe and found it useful. \\n \\u2026. we ended up with 3 versions - 1 per health economy. Although the groups were \\nsmall each logframe had its own \\'flavour\\', which we felt was very important in terms \\nof reflecting local ownership and culture. When I informed the SHA Trust Directors \\nof Modernisation about this work they asked if I could produce one framework for the \\nwhole patch. I did this by informal thematic analysis \\u2026 and kept it to the Purpose and \\nOutputs with indicators (attached).\" \\nHowever, Fiona had some pithy comments about the use of systemic methods - most \\nspecifically Logical Framework in her case:  \\n\"I keep asking the Trust CWP leads if they are happy with the Logframe and can\\'t \\nhonestly say that they really understand or utilise it. BUT I find it a very useful \\nworking tool to refer back to periodically. I think the main problem is that it quickly \\nbecomes out of date in terms of the specific outputs and indicators. I could keep \\n 14\\nupdating it, but then it would lose the ownership of the wider team. However the 1 \\nside of A4 attached is quite an impressive document to cirulate when people ask what \\nI do and what CWP is about!! We also use it within the team of CWP facilitators to \\nhelp check the direction of current work.\" \\nMore recently, Fiona has added that, the outcome she was looking for was for the \\nwork of the role re-designers to become embedded within the work of the Trusts. But \\nhow to evaluate if this has been happening and if so if it was the work of her team that \\nhas made it happen? What she can prove is that she had measures in place as part of \\nthe project plan. The Logframe was the work plan and seemed to provide a very good \\nframework to measure themselves against. Revisiting the Logframe as an evaluation \\nexercise and using it as a review tool has given a recent added value for Fiona and her \\nteam for all the work that went into producing it. They can see where they\\u2019ve come \\nfrom. As she says:  \\n\\u201cWe can step back and say: we had something to do and we got on with it\\u201d. \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 5. Tasks and issues arising from a rich picture exercise \\n \\n 15\\nLynne Lewis, NVQ/Learning Account Manager applied Logical Framework approach \\nto her project: Moving Forward Together For People With Learning Disability \\nLynne comments on the process as follows:  \\n\"I have used the process of Logical Frameworks for a project to assist with the Skills \\nEscalator approach within Learning Disabilities. The process of logical framework \\nhas assisted with a systematic approach to achieving a goal. It breaks down tasks into \\nbite sized processes, with clear progression to the ultimate goal. The difference from \\nmy own personal point of view with this process compared to the average action plan, \\nis the thought process behind the bite sized processes. Thought of what could happen, \\nand what effect this has on the overall process. An ordinary action plan will inform \\nwho does what by when, but does not inform of the contingency plans. My own style \\nof learning was assisted by having the dedicated tutor working through the logical \\nframework step by step, with a dedicated group, for a common goal. I found a \\nprevious session of logical frameworks with a very large group less effective. \\n \\n \\nFigure 6. An activity plan \\n \\n 16\\nJane Rook, (Podiatry Continuous Professional Development), who was lead for the \\nWDD and was project managing the development of an agreed system in Shropshire \\nand Staffordshire for re-registration of Podiatrists with the Health Professional \\nCouncil observed: \\n\"There is something about having the actual flip chart paper to work from and \\n the post it notes that makes the log frame real and living. I have preferred to have \\nthese big and creative bits of paper on the wall to work from and the rich picture to \\nwork from in terms of further working out how to tackle the unsaid issues. \\nWe are almost at the end of the project and the log frame was a timely reminder as we \\nwent along of how to plan to achieve specific targets and to keep me on target. \\nVery encouraging to tick off the boxes as I went along . \\nI did write the document up properly but have used this version only to send out to \\nprove that I do have a project plan to work to. I think it was a definite focus for the \\nsteering group to work to as well They have appreciated that the wider Authority \\nworks to this planning process and felt more corporate as a result. \\nAll in all it was probably a lot easier than some of the project plans based on \\nMicrosoft and Prince systems. Probably appealed to my need for visual clues for my \\nlearning style\" \\nIn private communication Jane has indicated that she would have liked to have used \\nthe methodology with the Steering Group right at the beginning of her planning \\nprocess but even half way through it was worth doing and proved valuable. Two \\nmajor benefits included:  \\n\\u2022 it enabled the mixed range of different kinds of managers with a diverse \\nunderstanding of project management (Prinz, Microsoft etc.) to share one \\napproach and secondly  \\n\\u2022 it enabled really meaningful conversations with all voices being valued as to \\nwhat the project was about and whether or not everyone shared the same \\nvision. . \\n \\n 17\\n \\nFigure 7. A Logical Framework under development \\n \\nAnn, as commissioning officer for the workshops observed:  \\n\"The dimension that has emerged as so powerful for me in this research is the quality \\nof the learning that has been going on in the workshops as groups of colleagues \\ndiscussed the elements of their project in order to agree the plan.\"  \\n \\nAuthor Reflections and Conclusions  \\nAs already stated, the authors are not making definitive claims for the WDD \\nexperience but, recalling our initial research question: \"could systemic tools and \\ntechniques effectively develop the various work streams of the WDD?\", from the \\ncomments of participants, and the experiences of the authors some modest claims, \\nseeking further testing, can be suggested: \\n1. The use of systemic and participatory techniques was greeted by most of those \\non the workshops as a relief and a change from their previous experiences of \\nsuch events.  \\n 18\\n2. SSM provided teams with the basis to think widely and divergently about their \\nwork context and gave them the \\'slack\\' to think differently \\n3. Most of those involved in teams which they worked with regularly, found the \\nexperience helpful to the deeper understanding of the tasks which they had \\nbeen allocated. \\n4. Those who worked in unfamiliar teams found the brainstorming and sharing \\ninvolved helpful in their wider understanding of the work of the SSWDD \\n5. LFA was seen as being a readily applicable tool for project planning.  \\n \\nIf these are the positive reflections, some more negative outcomes were: \\n1. Small teams seemed to get more from the process than large \\n2. The work of one team was not readily understandable or usable to another \\n3. The sustainability of the process is a key point. Without renewal and \\ncontinued investment in support - some of the good outcomes of the process \\ncould dilute over time.  \\n \\nIn summary, it appears to the authors that some important foundations have been built \\nfor essential collaboration to deliver workforce solutions to the challenging task of \\ntrying to achieve integrated services in the Staffordshire and Shropshire areas. Most \\ncritically, an awareness of the importance of a methodical approach to planning major \\nnew initiatives has been raised. \\n \\n 19\\n \\nReferences \\nBaccarini, D.

       " u'More specifically, this paper arises from the experiences of the application of \\nsystemic approaches to workforce re-modelling following the establishment of the \\nnew role of Associate Director Workforce Development (ADWD) (Health and Social \\nCare Integration) for the Shropshire and Staffordshire Workforce Development \\nConfederation.',\n",

       " u'The care workforce is in a climate of continuous change, invoking wide scale \\nrethinking on almost all aspects of its use and development (for a comprehensive \\ndiscussion of key issues see: Davies 2003).',\n",
       " u'The NHS workforce for the Staffordshire \\nand Shropshire area (the focus of this paper) is 35,000 and the social care workforce is \\nestimated to be nearly as great but largely employed outside the Social Services \\nDepartments.',\n",
       " u'Rather, it is supplied by hundreds of different private and charitable \\nbusiness employers (these organisations face their own, related challenges, see: \\nHarris, Cairns et al.',\n",

       " u'Its formation was part of the \\nNHS restructuring of Regional Authorities which devolved budgets and \\ncommissioning power to these confederations across the country.',\n",
       " u'In 2004 the \\n 3\\nWorkforce Development Confederations in England were integrated into each of the \\n28 Strategic Health Authorities adding another dimension to the latter\\u2019s performance \\nmanagement role which had been constantly expanding since they had been brought \\ninto being in 2002.',\n",
       " u'In the Shropshire and Staffordshire area this meant that the Confederation was now to \\nbecome the Workforce Development Directorate (or WDD) of the Shropshire and \\nStaffordshire Strategic Health Authority alongside Directorates for Service \\nImprovement, Health Strategy, and Performance and Finance.',\n",
       " u'The WDD was tasked \\nwith ensuring the local implementation of national policy.',\n",
       " u'Further, and developing \\nfrom this role, there is an expectation that the WDD is also performance managing \\nHuman Resource (HR) improvement aspects of the work of the Health Trusts in line \\nwith Department of Health (DoH) requirements.',\n",
       " u'This is alongside the continuing \\nmulti-million pound commissioning role for university provision of health \\nprofessional programmes and funding of secondment to these.',\n",
       " u'Problem issues abound for the WDD to manage.',\n",
       " u'Problems of data shortage on vital \\nteams within the NHS are well documented (see, for example: Stubbings and Scott \\n200; Editorial 2004), the development of decentralised teams working at local level \\nseems patchy at best (Deeming 2004), and leadership training and effectiveness \\nremains critical (e.g.',\n",

       " u'What we\\u2019re working to \\nachieve is not only an understanding of functional processes and the skills \\ndemonstrated by the current workforce to deliver services, but a specification of the \\nskill sets required to deliver evolving, emerging and future service models.\\u201d \\n(Guardian newspaper, June 2001) \\n 4\\nThe need for the application of systemic processes and methods in the further \\ndevelopment of the WDD remit was also clear:  \\n\\u201cIn describing you as the Social Care guru in the WDC, we need to make one point \\nabsolutely clear: this is not the time or place for professional advocacy.',\n",

       " u'In her own words:  \\n\"To be able to advise on the scope for integrated workforce planning and development \\nand the methods by which that may be achieved could itself only be achieved through \\nwide consultation with stakeholders.',\n",
       " u'Harvesting these stakeholders\\u2019 ideas whilst \\ngaining an understanding of their opinions, their perspectives and their assumptions \\nwould be an important task en route\".',\n",
       " u'The main requirement from the WDD was to provide Health and Care Professionals \\nwith transferable skills to aid in the planning, management and development of \\nprojects across the region.',\n",
       " u'It was judged that systemic methods, focused on problem \\nsolving, would be most likely to meet this need.',\n",
       " u'Again, in Ann\\'s words: \\n\"To be able to advise on reforms in working practices and on new roles which may be \\nachievable and provide up to date intelligence on key workforce issues in health and \\nsocial care I would need to create the kind of mini-environments that would enable \\nme to qualitatively research through using \\u201cparticipative inquiry\\u201d and health and care \\npathway and process analysis a shared understanding with those involved across \\ndiffering cultures of the current working practices and roles being applied by the NHS \\nand Social Care organisations\" \\n \\nIt had further been agreed between Ann and Simon that all training involve real \\nprojects in the pipeline.',\n",

       " u\"No one person should be seen as being the team 'expert', all should \\ncontribute and participate.\",\n",
       " u'Ann notes on this point: \\n\"The notion of \\u201creleasing\\u201d ideas about the transformations needed and the way to \\nachieve them to bring about the required modernisation from different people in all \\nparts of the affected workforce has been very motivating\".',\n",

       " u'The executive team would also be introduced to the method.',\n",
       " u'This was a crucial plus \\nfor the research as it meant that the WDD would gain understanding of the methods \\nacross the organisational hierarchy.',\n",
       " u'This is rare in the experience of the authors and \\nthe lack of such senior buy-in often means that initiatives lack senior champions later \\nin the process.',\n",

       " u'Although approaches have changed \\nand developed over time, one main methodology, applied across undergraduate and \\npostgraduate teaching, has been Soft Systems Methodology or SSM.',\n",
       " u'This approach - \\nfirst advocated and subsequently developed by Checkland et al (Checkland 1981; \\nCheckland and Scholes 1990; Checkland 1994; Checkland 2001) has been included in \\nOpen University courses and developed into a distance learning format (Open \\nUniversity 1987; Open University 2000).',\n",

       " u\"1990; Haynes 1995; Jayaratna 1997; Probert \\n1998; Flood 2001; Holwell 2001) and it has been applied in a wide variety of contexts \\n 8\\n- most recently the main author's have turned to the complex field of information \\nsystems (Checkland and Holwell 1998).\",\n",
       " u'SSM has a range of strengths to advocate its use in the development of project \\nplanning and can be seen as an aid to other systemic approaches in encouraging \\nimaginative problem solving (see for example: Brookfield 1991; Issacs 1999; Wenger \\n1999).',\n",
       " u'From the perspective of the present authors these can be listed as: \\n1. a capacity to make use of SSM at a very basic level very quickly - it can be \\nadopted rapidly \\n2.',\n",
       " u'SSM can be applied in such a way as to provide three outcomes essential for a \\nproject: a rich picture of what is, a root definition of what could be and an \\nactivity plan or conceptual model of how to get there.',\n",

       " u'In further developing the project plan, and taking it up to implementation, monitoring \\nand evaluation, the Logical Framework Approach or LFA has been applied in a \\nvariety of contexts (Coleman 1987; Bell 1998; Baccarini 1999; Kumar and Corbridge \\n2002; Biggs and Smith 2003; Crawford 2003; Crawford 2003; Dale 2003) and, as \\nwith SSM, has found its way into Open University Systems teaching (Open \\nUniversity 1997; Open University 2000; Open University 2004).',\n",
