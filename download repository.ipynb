This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com\\nAbstract Copper and iron metabolism have been\\nknown to interact for many years. We have previously\\nshown, during pregnancy, that copper levels in the\\nmaternal liver rise as a consequence of iron deficiency,\\nbut that levels in the fetal liver decrease. In this paper,\\nwe measure expression of genes involved in copper\\nmetabolism in fetal and postnatal liver, to test whether\\nalterations can explain this observation. Additionally,\\nwe study the extent to which gene expression changes\\nin the latter stages of pregnancy and in the perinatal\\nperiod. Ctr1 expression levels dropped to term, rising\\nagain thereafter. There was no difference in gene\\nexpression between control and iron deficient animals.\\nAtox1 expression remained approximately stable until\\nterm, and then there was a rise to a maximum at about\\nDay 8. Atp7a expression levels remained constant,\\nexcept for a brief drop at term. Atp7b levels, in contrast,\\ndecreased from a maximum early in gestation to low\\nlevels in the term and post-natal livers. Ceruloplasmin\\nexpression appeared to be diametrically opposite to\\nAtp7b. The other two metallochaperones showed the\\nsame pattern of expression as Atox1, with a decrease to\\nterm, a rise at Day 1, or a rise after birth followed by a\\nbrief decrease at about Day 3. None of the genes were\\nsignificantly affected by iron deficiency, suggesting\\nthat changes in expression cannot explain the altered\\ncopper levels in the fetal and neonatal liver.\\nKeywords Copper-iron interactions \\x02 Perinatal\\ndevelopment \\x02 Metallochaperones \\x02 ATP7A \\x02 ATP7B \\x02\\nCopper metabolism \\x02 Hooded Lister rats\\nIntroduction\\nCopper is a micronutrient, essential for normal growth\\nand development. It is a cofactor for enzymes that\\ncatalyze reactions used in fundamental metabolic\\nprocesses, including respiratory oxidation, neurotrans-\\nmitter synthesis, iron uptake regulation, and connec-\\ntive tissue formation (Lutsenko et al. 2007). However,\\nan excess of copper has the potential to be toxic, as the\\nions are potent generators of free radicals, which could\\nlead to oxidative damage of proteins, lipids and nucleic\\nacids (Lutsenko et al. 2007; Van den Berghe and\\nKlomp 2010; Velthuis et al. 2009). Consequently,\\norganisms have developed complex and genetically\\nregulated control mechanisms for maintaining the\\nbalance between essential and toxic copper levels.\\nIn mammals, copper is absorbed mainly in the\\nstomach and duodenum and is transported in plasma to\\nM.

The copper\\nis stored primarily as a copper-metallothionein com-\\nplex (Bauerly et al. 2005; Czachor et al. 2002; Davis\\nand Cousins 2000) and is excreted through bile\\n(Huster et al. 2006; Wijmenga and Klomp 2004).\\nCopper uptake by hepatocytes is mediated by the\\nhigh affinity copper transporter 1 (CTR1) (Kuo et al.\\n2001, 2006). In the cell the copper is bound to\\nmetallochaperones, and transported to the different\\ncompartments of the cell (O\\u2019Halloran and Cizewski\\nCulotta 2000). Different chaperones deliver the copper\\nto different enzymes. The copper chaperone of\\nsuperoxide dismutase (CCS) partitions copper for\\nSOD synthesis (Wong et al. 2000; Bertinato et al.\\n2003; Prohaska et al. 2003). Copper ions bound to\\nCOX 17 chaperone are transported to mitochondria\\nwhere they are bound to the subunits of the cyto-\\nchrome-c oxidase (Nevitt et al. 2012; Kako et al. 2004;\\nPunter and Glerum 2003). ATOX1 transport copper to\\nthe trans-Golgi network where it is incorporated into\\nthe two Cu-transporting ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B\\nproteins (Barry et al. 2010; Pufahl et al. 1997;\\nLutsenko et al. 2007, 2008). In hepatocytes, ATP7B\\ndelivers copper to ceruloplasmin, a major form of\\ncopper in serum. It is also the pathway of excretion of\\ncopper into the bile (Huster et al. 2006; La Fontaine\\net al. 2001; Wijmenga and Klomp 2004). ATP7A is\\nnot expressed in the adult liver, but in other tissues is\\ninvolved in copper excretion and absorption. These\\ndata are summarized in Fig. 1.\\nMetabolic interactions between the two essential\\nelements, copper and iron, have been known for many\\nyears (McArdle 1992; McArdle et al. 2008; Gambling\\net al. 2011). In the early part of the last century it was\\nshown that copper could facilitate hemoglobin forma-\\ntion in anemic rats (Hart et al. 1928). More recently, it\\nhas been demonstrated that iron metabolism is criti-\\ncally dependent on ferroxidases, most of which are\\ncopper enzymes. How iron alters copper metabolism is\\nnot so well understood. We have previously shown\\nthat iron deficiency results in accumulation of copper\\nin the maternal, but not fetal liver. How this occurs is\\nnot clear but is presumably related to alterations in\\ngene expression in one of the major organs involved in\\niron and copper transfer from mother to fetus. In this\\npaper, therefore, we examine the effect of iron\\ndeficiency on expression of the genes of copper\\nmetabolism, with a view to identifying the changes\\nthat could explain alterations in copper levels in the\\nmaternal and fetal livers.\\nMaterials and methods\\nAnimals and diets\\nEthical approval\\nAll animal experiments were performed in the Biore-\\nsources Unit of the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and\\nHealth, under licence from the United Kingdom Home\\nOffice in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific\\nProcedures) Act, 1986. The study was approved by the\\nUK Home Office (Project Licence PPL 60/3606) and\\nthe Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health Ethics\\nReview Committee (approval ID SA09/03E).\\nExperimental diets\\nThe experimental diets were based on a dried egg\\nalbumin diet and conformed to American Institute of\\nNutrition guidelines for laboratory animals (Williams\\nand Mills 1970). FeSO4 was added to achieve levels of\\nadded iron of 50 (control diet) and 7.5 (iron deficient\\ndiet) mg kg-1. Dietary ingredients were purchased\\nFig. 1 The model used to study gene expression in this paper.\\nCopper is taken up across the cell membrane, binds to the\\nrelevant chaperone and is incorporated into the target protein.\\nMore information is given in the text in the relevant section\\n52 Biometals (2015) 28:51\\u201359\\n123\\nfrom Mayjex Ltd (Chalfont-St Peter, UK), BDH\\nChemicals (Poole, UK) or Sigma (Poole, UK). Diet\\nformulations have all previously been used (Gambling\\net al. 2003a).\\nExperimental animals and tissue collection\\nExperiments were performed using weanling female\\nrats of the Rowett Hooded Lister strain. Animals were\\nhoused in cages under constant conditions (tempera-\\nture, humidity, 12L:12D illumination photoperiod).\\nFemale weanling rats were fed control diet for\\n2 weeks, before being randomised into two groups.\\nThe first group remained on the control diet through-\\nout the experiment, including pregnancy, whilst the\\nscond were given the iron deficient diet for 4 weeks\\nprior to mating. The rats were mated with males of the\\nsame strain. Mating was confirmed by detection of a\\nvaginal plug, and this day was denoted as Day 0.5. The\\nfemale rats were maintained on the same diet\\nthroughout pregnancy.\\nAt times stated in the results, 8 rats from each\\ngroup were killed as described below. At parturition,\\nblood and tissue samples were taken from 8 dams\\nand their litters, from birth the control and iron\\ndeficient groups. Following parturition all remaining\\ndams fed on control diet during pregnancy continued\\non this diet. At the same time dams fed on the iron\\ndeficient diet during pregnancy were split into two\\ngroups, half remained on the iron deficient diet,\\nwhilst the diet for the remaining dams was changed\\nto the control diet. Within 24 h of birth all litters\\nwere culled to 8 pups, with male pups being kept\\npreferentially. Over the next 10 days, there were 4\\ntime points at which 8 dams and their litters from\\neach of the now 3 groups, were killed and blood and\\ntissue samples taken. These time points were 1, 3, 7\\nand 10 days after birth.\\nDams were anesthetized with isoflurane, and\\nmaternal blood samples collected from the heart.\\nThe dams were then killed by cervical dislocation.\\nTissue samples were also taken from the dam. The\\nfetuses or neonates were weighed, and then killed by\\ndecapitation. Blood samples were collected from each\\nof the neonates, and pooled to provide a representative\\nlitter sample. Organs were weighed and snap frozen in\\nliquid nitrogen before being stored at -80 \\x03C. In order\\nto obtain representative samples, tissues from the 3\\npups closest to the litter median, determined by body\\nweight, were pooled and ground. These pooled\\nsamples were used for all future analysis.\\nRNA isolation\\nTotal RNA was prepared from 50 mg of frozen liver\\ntissue by homogenizing in cold TRI reagent (Helena\\nBiosciences, Sunderland, UK) according to the man-\\nufacturer\\u2019s instructions. RNA were precipitated in\\nisopropanol and dissolved in DNAse, RNASe free\\nwater. Concentration of RNA in samples was mea-\\nsured in a NanoDropTM 2000c spectrophotometer\\n(Thermo Scientific) OD 260/280 and purify of RNA\\nwas estimated using OD 260/230.

Copper deficiency, therefore,\\nresults in accumulation of iron in the liver, and in the\\nkidney and brain. The effect of iron deficiency on\\ncopper metabolism is not so well studied. We have\\nshown, as have others (Sherman and Moran 1984;\\nSherman and Tissue 1981) that, during pregnancy,\\ncopper levels in the fetal liver decrease in response to\\nmaternal iron deficiency, in contrast to the maternal\\nliver, where iron deficiency results in an increase in\\ncopper levels (Gambling et al. 2004). How this occurs\\nis not known. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that\\nalterations in expression levels of the genes involved\\nin copper metabolism are involved in the mechanism.\\nFurther, we also examine how gene expression\\nchanges as development proceeds through late gesta-\\ntion and the early neonatal period.\\nTerao and Owen (1977) reported that in rats, the\\ncopper concentration in the fetal liver was highest at\\nday 18 of pregnancy and decreased to day 21. After\\nbirth, copper levels significantly increased up to\\npostnatal day 7. From then, levels remained high until\\nabout the second week of life, thereafter decreasing to\\nadult levels by six weeks of age (Terao and Owen\\n1977). In mammalian cells, copper import is primarily\\nmediated by CTR1 protein (Ansede et al. 2009; Kim\\net al. 2009; Lee et al. 2002; Nose et al. 2006; Van den\\nBerghe and Klomp 2010). Kuo et al. (2006) showed\\nthat in mice and rats CTR1 expression is regulated by\\ncopper status (Bauerly et al. 2005; Kuo et al. 2006). In\\nthe present study we found that Ctr1 gene expression\\nmatched these patterns. We also found that in neonatal\\nrats after birth Ctr1 expression in the liver is rather low\\nand gradually increased. There was no apparent effect\\nof iron deficiency on expression of the Ctr1 gene at\\nany stage in gestation.\\nFollowing uptake across the cell membrane, copper\\nis bound to one of a class of proteins called metallo-\\nchaperones. Several have been identified, each of\\nwhich will deliver copper from the membrane to a\\nparticular target protein. These targets are shown in\\nFig. 1.\\nAnti-oxidant 1 protein (ATOX1) (Klomp et al.\\n1997), transports Cu to ATP7A and ATP7B, the Cu-\\ntransport ATPases (Lutsenko et al. 2007, 2008; Van\\nden Berghe and Klomp 2010). In adult liver, ATP7A\\nexpression is extremely low (Lenartowicz et al. 2010).\\nHowever, in the fetus and neonate, both ATPases are\\nexpressed. Interestingly, expression levels of Atp7a,\\nbut not Atp7b, and Atox1 are inversely proportional.\\nWhy this should be is not clear, but it could be related\\nto either regulation of Atp7a by ATOX1, or possibly to\\nthe transcription factor function of ATOX1. Itoh and\\nco-workers showed that copper promotes transport of\\nATOX1 protein to the nucleus where it is bound to the\\npromoter of regulated genes resulting in up-regulation\\nof Cycline D1, (Ccnd 1), and extracellular SOD\\n(SOD3) genes (Itoh et al. 2008, 2009).\\nIn hepatocytes, ATP7B protein is localized in the\\ntrans-Golgi network (Schaefer et al. 1999; Bingham\\net al. 1996) where it is involved in the process of Cu\\nbinding to apo-ceruloplasmin (Lutsenko et al. 2007;\\nTerada et al. 1998). It also transfers copper from the\\nhepatocyte to the bile in the case of copper excess\\n(Bauerly et al. 2005; Roelofsen et al. 2000; Huster\\net al. 2006; Wijmenga and Klomp 2004). In the fetus,\\nthe bile duct is not patent, and copper accumulates in\\nthe liver (Guo et al. 2005; Lutsenko et al. 2003; La\\nFontaine and Mercer 2007; Mercer et al. 2003;\\nSchaefer et al. 1999), although it may also be that\\nthe copper is accumulated in order to provide a store\\nfor the perinatal period.\\nThis is the first study to compare Atp7b and Atp7a\\nexpression levels in the liver of fetal and neonatal\\nanimals. Previous work from our laboratories showed\\ndevelopmental regulation of Atp7a expression in the\\nliver of neonatal mice (Lenartowicz et al. 2010, 2011)\\nbut little is known about expression pattern of Atp7b in\\nthe liver. Here, we show that in the liver of the\\nneonatal rats Atp7a expression dropped in the perina-\\ntal period, but then stabilised, while Atp7b expression\\nremained low. The data suggest that, in the liver of\\nvery young animals, Atp7a/ATP7A plays the domi-\\nnant role in regulation of copper metabolism. By\\nadulthood, this is reversed, and Atp7b/ATP7B is the\\nonly transporter. Alternatively, the data could reflect\\nthe relatively important role the fetal and neonatal\\nliver plays in haematopoiesis, and the high concen-\\ntration of haematopoietic cells in the liver.\\nCeruloplasmin is a ferroxidase, containing 6 Cu\\natoms per molecule protein, and is required for\\noxidation of Fe2? to Fe3? and thus for iron efflux\\nfrom the cells via ferroportin. Ceruloplasmin is also\\nthe major plasma copper binding protein (Tran et al.\\n2002; Hellman and Gitlin 2002; Broderius et al.\\n2010; Prohaska 2011). Incorporation of copper to\\nthe ceruloplasmin is mediated by ATP7B protein\\n56 Biometals (2015) 28:51\\u201359\\n123\\n(Terada et al. 1998). During development, ceruloplas-\\nmin expression starts very early (Fleming and Gitlin\\n1990; Lee et al. 1993) and mRNA in the liver was\\ndetected at E15. Expression increases between 17th\\nand 20th day of gestation and drops just before\\ndelivery (Fleming and Gitlin 1990). Such findings\\nclosely overlap with our own results. Terao and Owen\\n(1977) reported that ceruloplasmin protein levels in\\nthe liver of rat pups increase sharply in the first 24 h\\nafter birth, which also fits with our data. Ceruloplas-\\nmin gene expression unexpectedly significantly\\ndecreased at Day 3. In rats in the 3th day postpartum\\ncopper levels in the mother\\u2019s milk are highest and drop\\nthereafter (Terao and Owen 1977). We speculate that\\ndecreasing ceruloplasmin synthesis at this stage may\\nprotect the neonates against excess copper. As copper\\nin the milk decreases thereafter, Cp levels rise again.\\nBoth in vitro experiments on isolated hepatocytes\\n(McArdle et al. 1990) and in vivo studies on mice and\\nrats indicated that copper deficiency have no impact on\\nceruloplasmin mRNA in the liver (Prohaska 2011;\\nMercer et al. 1991; Mostad and Prohaska 2011) and\\nour current data also show no difference between\\ncontrol and Fe deficient livers.\\nCopper, zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) pro-\\ntects cells against reactive oxygen species that are\\ngenerated during the processes of oxidative metabo-\\nlism. Activity of SOD1 is closely dependent on its\\ncopper chaperone, CCS, which is necessary for\\ninsertion of Cu ions to apo-SOD1 (Wong et al.\\n2000). Copper supplementation results in decreasing\\nof CCS and SOD1 mRNA level both in the liver and\\nperipheral mononuclear blood cells (Suazo et al. 2008;\\nHan et al. 2009). Here, we found a significant decrease\\nin CCS expression, which may also be caused by the\\nincrease in Cu levels. It is known that in pups born\\nfrom Fe deficient mothers copper concentration in the\\nliver is significantly increased (Sherman and Moran\\n1984; Sherman and Tissue 1981). In both investigated\\ngroup of rats CCS mRNA level rapidly and signifi-\\ncantly increased during first 24 h of postnatal life.\\nCytochrome c oxidase is a terminal complex in the\\nrespiratory chain (Oswald et al. 2009; Voronova et al.\\n2007). Uptake, transport and delivery of the copper\\nions to the enzyme are complicated processes; requir-\\ning activity at least six copper chaperones (Voronova\\net al. 2007). One of these is COX 17, a small\\nhydrophobic protein which contains copper binding\\ndomains, binds and transports copper ions in the\\ncytoplasm and also participates in shuttling Cu ions\\nthrough the mitochondrial membrane to the inter-\\nmembrane mitochondrial space (Oswald et al. 2009;\\nVoronova et al. 2007; Kako et al. 2004; Punter and\\nGlerum 2003). In rats Cox 17 expression in the brain\\nand heart was detected in prenatal life and it was\\nshown that the expression profile was age- and tissue-\\ndependent and changes during development (Kako\\net al. 2000). In the present study we analysed\\nexpression of the Cox 17 in the liver of the fetus and\\nneonatal rats and found similar results. In the iron\\ndeficient animals after birth, Cox17 expression was\\nhigher than control. This may be related to different\\nnutritional profiles in the iron-deficinet dams, but may\\nalso be a consequence of reduced mitochondrial\\nfunction in the iron deficient animals.\\nIn summary, the data presented show that, while\\nthere are marked changes in the expression of the\\ngenes of copper metabolism while development\\nproceeds, the consequences of iron deficiency are\\nlimited and cannot explain the increasing copper\\nlevels in the iron deficient liver.\\nAcknowledgments The authors\\u2019 work is supported by\\nScottish Government (Rural and Environmental Scientific and\\nAnalytical Services).
