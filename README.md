# TDM tutorial using CORE resources

## Requirements

Register a CORE API key and place it to a file called api_key.secret that is git ignored to avoid tracking big (~10Mb) files.

Highly recommended:
Run create_cache python notebook to populate /data folder with cached data to be used for the main notebook (tdm demo)

## Run

jupyter notebook
select tdm demo.ipynb
